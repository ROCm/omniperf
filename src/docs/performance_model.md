# AMD Instinct(tm) MI Series Accelerator Performance Model

```eval_rst
.. sectionauthor:: Nicholas Curtis <nicholas.curtis@amd.com>
```

Omniperf makes available an extensive list of metrics to better understand achieved application performance on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators including Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPUs such as the AMD Instinct MI50, CDNA(tm) accelerators such as the MI100, and CDNA(tm) 2 accelerators such as MI250X/250/210.

To best utilize this profiling data, it is vital to understand the role of various hardware blocks of AMD Instinct accelerators. This section aims to describe each hardware block on the accelerator as interacted with by a software developer, and give a deeper understanding of the metrics reported therein.  Refer to [Profiling with Omniperf by Example](profiling-with-omniperf) for more practical examples and detail on how to use Omniperf to optimize your code.

```{note}
In this document, we use `MI2XX` to refer to any of the AMD Instinct(tm) MI250X, MI250, and MI210 CDNA2 accelerators interchangeably for situations where the exact product in question is not relevant.
For more details on the differences between these accelerators, we refer the reader to the [MI250X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/server-accelerators/instinct-mi250x), [MI250](https://www.amd.com/en/products/server-accelerators/instinct-mi250) and [MI210](https://www.amd.com/en/products/server-accelerators/amd-instinct-mi210) product pages.
```


(CU)=
## Compute Unit (CU)

The Compute Unit (CU) is responsible for executing a user's kernels on AMD's CDNA(tm) accelerators. All [wavefronts](wavefront) of a [workgroup](workgroup) are scheduled on the same CU.

![GCN Compute Unit](images/gcn_compute_unit.png)

The CU consists of several independent pipelines / functional units:

- The vector arithmetic logic unit (VALU) is composed of multiple Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vector processors, Vector General Purpose Registers (VGPRs) and instruction buffers.  The VALU is responsible for executing much of the computational work on CDNA accelerators, including (but not limited to) floating-point operations (FLOPs), integer operations (IOPs), etc.
- The vector memory (VMEM) unit is responsible for issuing loads, stores and atomic operations that interact with the memory system.
- The Scalar Arithmetic Logic Unit (SALU) is shared by all threads in a [wavefront](wavefront), and is responsible for executing instructions that are known to be uniform across the wavefront at compile-time.  The SALU has a memory unit (SMEM) for interacting with memory, but it cannot issue separately from the SALU.
- The Local Data Share (LDS) is an on-CU software-managed scratchpad memory that can be used to efficiently share data between all threads in a [workgroup](workgroup).
- The scheduler is responsible for issuing and decoding instructions for all the [wavefronts](wavefront) on the compute unit.
- The vector L1 data cache (vL1D) is the first level cache local to the compute unit.  On current CDNA accelerators, the vL1D is write-through. The vL1D caches from multiple compute units are kept coherent with one another through software instructions.
- CDNA accelerators --- i.e., the MI100 and newer --- contain specialized matrix-multiplication accelerator pipelines known as the [Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA)](mfma).

For a more thorough description of a compute unit on a CDNA accelerator, see [An introduction to AMD GPU
Programming with HIP](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AMD_GPU_HIP_training_20190906.pdf), specifically slides 22-28, and [Layla Mah's: The AMD GCN Architecture - A Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 27.

The [Pipeline Descriptions section](ERD) details the various execution pipelines (VALU, SALU, LDS, Scheduler, etc.).
The metrics presented by Omniperf for these pipelines are described in [Pipeline Metrics section](ERM).
Finally, the [vL1D](vL1D) cache and [LDS](LDS) will be described their own sections.


(ERD)=
### Pipeline Descriptions

(valu)=
#### Vector Arithmetic Logic Unit (VALU)

The vector arithmetic logic unit (VALU) executes vector instructions over an entire wavefront, each [work-item](Workitem) (or, vector-lane) potentially operating on distinct data.
The VALU of a CDNA accelerator or GCN GPU typically consists of:

- four 16-wide SIMD processors (see [An introduction to AMD GPU
Programming with HIP](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AMD_GPU_HIP_training_20190906.pdf) for more details)
- four 64 or 128 KiB VGPR files (yielding a total of 256-512 KiB total per CU), see [AGPRs](agprs) for more detail.
- An instruction buffer (per-SIMD) that contains execution slots for up to 8 wavefronts (for 32 total wavefront slots on each CU).
- A vector memory (VMEM) unit which transfers data between VGPRs and memory; each work-item supplies its own memory address and supplies or receives unique data.
- CDNA accelerators, such as the MI100 and [MI2XX](2xxnote), contain additional [Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA) units](https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-lab-notes/amd-lab-notes-matrix-cores-readme/).

In order to support branching / conditionals, each wavefront in the VALU has a distinct execution mask which determines which work-items in the wavefront are active for the currently executing instruction.
When executing a VALU instruction, inactive work-items (according to the current execution mask of the wavefront) do not execute the instruction and are treated as no-ops.

```{note}
On GCN GPUs and the CDNA MI100 accelerator, there are slots for up to 10 wavefronts in the instruction buffer, but generally occupancy is limited by other factors to 32 waves per [Compute Unit](CU).
On the CDNA2 [MI2XX](2xxnote) series accelerators, there are only 8 waveslots per-SIMD.
```

(salu)=
#### Scalar Arithmetic Logic Unit (SALU)

The scalar arithmetic logic unit (SALU) executes instructions that are shared between all work-items in a wavefront.  This includes control-flow -- such as if/else conditionals, branches and looping -- pointer arithmetic, loading common values, etc.
The SALU consists of:

- a scalar processor capable of various arithmetic, conditional, and comparison (etc.) operations.  See, e.g., [Chapter 5. Scalar ALU Operations](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/instinct-mi200-cdna2-instruction-set-architecture.pdf) of the CDNA2 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Guide for more detail.
- a 12.5 KiB Scalar General Purpose Register (SGPR) file
- a scalar memory (SMEM) unit which transfers data between SGPRs and memory

Data loaded by the SMEM can be cached in the [scalar L1 data cache](sL1D), and is typically only used for read-only, uniform accesses such as kernel arguments, or HIP's `__constant__` memory.

(lds)=
#### Local Data Share (LDS)

The local data share (LDS, a.k.a., "shared memory") is fast on-CU scratchpad that can be explicitly managed by software to effectively share data and to coordinate between wavefronts in a workgroup.

```{figure} images/lds.*
:scale: 150 %
:alt: Performance model of the Local Data Share (LDS) on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
:align: center

Performance model of the Local Data Share (LDS) on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
```

Above is Omniperf's performance model of the LDS on CDNA accelerators (adapted from [GCN Architecture, by Mike Mantor](https://old.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc24/HC24-3-ManyCore/HC24.28.315-AMD.GCN.mantor_v1.pdf), slide 20).
The SIMDs in the [VALU](valu) are connected to the LDS in pairs (see above).
Only one SIMD per pair may issue an LDS instruction at a time, but both pairs may issue concurrently.

On CDNA accelerators, the LDS contains 32 banks and each bank is 4B wide.
The LDS is designed such that each bank can be read from/written to/atomically updated every cycle, for a total throughput of 128B/clock ([GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 40). 

On each of the two ports to the SIMDs, 64B can be sent in each direction per cycle. So, a single wavefront, coming from one of the 2 SIMDs in a pair, can only get back 64B/cycle (16 lanes per cycle). The input port is shared between data and address and this can affect achieved bandwidth for different data sizes. For example, a 64-wide store where each lane is sending a 4B value takes 8 cycles (50% peak bandwidth) while a 64-wide store where each lane is sending a 16B value takes 20 cycles (80% peak bandwidth).

In addition, the LDS contains conflict-resolution hardware to detect and handle bank conflicts.
A bank conflict occurs when two (or more) work-items in a wavefront want to read, write, or atomically update different addresses that map to the same bank in the same cycle.
In this case, the conflict detection hardware will determine a new schedule such that the access is split into multiple cycles with no conflicts in any single cycle.

When multiple work-items want to read from the same address within a bank, the result can be efficiently broadcasted ([GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 41).
Multiple work-items writing to the same address within a bank typically results undefined behavior in HIP and other languages, as the LDS will write the value from the last work-item as determined by the hardware scheduler ([GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 41).  This behavior may be useful in the very specific case of storing a uniform value.

Relatedly, an address conflict is defined as occurring when two (or more) work-items in a wavefront want to atomically update the same address on the same cycle.
As in a bank-conflict, this may cause additional cycles of work for the LDS operation to complete.

(branch)=
#### Branch

The branch unit is responsible for executing jumps and branches to execute control-flow operations.
Note that Branch operations are not used for execution mask updates, but only for “whole wavefront” control-flow changes.

(scheduler)=
#### Scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for arbitration and issue of instructions for all the wavefronts currently executing on the CU.  On every clock cycle, the scheduler:

- considers waves from one of the SIMD units for execution, selected in a round-robin fashion between the SIMDs in the [compute unit](CU)
- issues up to one instruction per wavefront on the selected SIMD
- issues up to one instruction per each of the instruction categories among the waves on the selected SIMD:
  - [VALU](valu)
  - [VMEM](valu) operations
  - [SALU](salu) / SMEM operations
  - [LDS](lds)
  - [Branch](branch) operations

This gives a maximum of five issued Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), per-SIMD, per-CU ([AMD GPU HIP Training](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AMD_GPU_HIP_training_20190906.pdf), [GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah)).

On CDNA accelerators with [MFMA](mfma) instructions, these are issued via the [VALU](valu). Some of them will execute on a separate functional unit and typically allow other [VALU](valu) operations to execute in their shadow (see the [MFMA](mfma) section for more detail).

```{note}
The IPC model used by Omniperf omits the following two complications for clarity.
First, CDNA accelerators contain other execution units on the CU that are unused for compute applications.
Second, so-called "internal" instructions (see [Layla Mah's GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 29) are not issued to a functional unit, and can technically cause the maximum IPC to _exceed_ 5 instructions per-cycle in special (largely unrealistic) cases.
The latter issue is discussed in more detail in our ['internal' IPC](Internal_ipc) example.
```

(mfma)=
#### Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA)

CDNA accelerators, such as the MI100 and [MI2XX](2xxnote), contain specialized hardware to accelerate matrix-matrix multiplications, also known as Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA) operations.
The exact operation types and supported formats may vary by accelerator.
The reader is referred to the [AMD matrix cores](https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-lab-notes/amd-lab-notes-matrix-cores-readme/) blog post on GPUOpen for a general discussion of these hardware units.
In addition, to explore the available MFMA instructions in-depth on various AMD accelerators (including the CDNA line), we recommend the [AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/amd_matrix_instruction_calculator).

```{code-block} shell-session

        GPRs required for C: 4
        GPRs required for D: 4
        GPR alignment requirement: 8 bytes
```

For the purposes of Omniperf, the MFMA unit is typically treated as a separate pipeline from the [VALU](valu), as other VALU instructions (along with other execution pipelines such as the SALU) can be issued during a portion of the total duration of an MFMA operation.

```{note}
The exact details of VALU and MFMA operation co-execution vary by instruction, and can be explored in more detail via the:
  - 'Can co-execute with VALU'
  - 'VALU co-execution cycles possible'

fields in the [AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/amd_matrix_instruction_calculator#example-of-querying-instruction-information)'s detailed instruction information.
```

#### Non-pipeline resources

In this section, we describe a few resources that are not standalone pipelines but are important for understanding performance optimization on CDNA accelerators.

(barrier)=
##### Barrier

Barriers are resources on the compute-unit of a CDNA accelerator that are used to implement synchronization primitives (e.g., HIP's `__syncthreads`).
Barriers are allocated to any workgroup that consists of more than a single wavefront.

(agprs)=
##### Accumulation vector General-Purpose Registers (AGPRs)

Accumulation vector General-Purpose Registers, or AGPRs, are special resources that are accessible to a subset of instructions focused on [MFMA](mfma) operations.
These registers allow the [MFMA](mfma) unit to access more than the normal maximum of 256 [architected Vector General-Purpose Registers (i.e., VGPRs)](valu) by having up to 256 in the architected space and up to 256 in the accumulation space.
Traditional VALU instructions can only use VGPRs in the architected space, and data can be moved to/from VGPRs↔AGPRs using specialized instructions (`v_accvgpr_*`).
These data movement instructions may be used by the compiler to implement lower-cost register-spill/fills on architectures with AGPRs.

AGPRs are not available on all AMD Instinct(tm) accelerators.
GCN GPUs, such as the AMD Instinct(tm) MI50 had a 256 KiB VGPR file.
The AMD Instinct(tm) MI100 (CDNA) has a 2x256 KiB register file, where one half is available as general-purpose VGPRs, and the other half is for matrix math accumulation VGPRs (AGPRs).
The AMD Instinct(tm) [MI2XX](2xxnote) (CDNA2) has a 512 KiB VGPR file per CU, where each wave can dynamically request up to 256 KiB of VGPRs and an additional 256 KiB of AGPRs.
For more detail, the reader is referred to the [following comment](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/issues/1689#issuecomment-1553751913).

(ERM)=
### Pipeline Metrics

In this section, we describe the metrics available in Omniperf to analyze the pipelines discussed in the [previous section](ERD).

#### Wavefront

(Wavefront_launch_stats)=
##### Wavefront Launch Stats

The wavefront launch stats panel gives general information about the kernel launch:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Grid Size
  - The total number of work-items (a.k.a "threads") launched as a part of the kernel dispatch.  In HIP, this is equivalent to the total grid size multiplied by the total workgroup (a.k.a "block") size.
  - [Work-items](Workitem)
* - Workgroup Size
  - The total number of work-items (a.k.a "threads") in each workgroup (a.k.a "block") launched as part of the kernel dispatch.  In HIP, this is equivalent to the total block size.
  - [Work-items](Workitem)
* - Total Wavefronts
  - The total number of wavefronts launched as part of the kernel dispatch.  On AMD Instinct(tm) CDNA accelerators and GCN GPUs, the wavefront size is always 64 work-items.  Thus, the total number of wavefronts should be equivalent to the ceiling of Grid Size divided by 64.
  - [Wavefronts](Wavefront)
* - Saved Wavefronts
  - The total number of wavefronts saved at a context-save, see [cwsr_enable](https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/amdgpu/module-parameters.html?highlight=cwsr).
  - [Wavefronts](Wavefront)
* - Restored Wavefronts
  - The total number of wavefronts restored from a context-save, see [cwsr_enable](https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/amdgpu/module-parameters.html?highlight=cwsr).
  - [Wavefronts](Wavefront)
* - VGPRs
  - The number of architected vector general-purpose registers allocated for the kernel, see [VALU](valu).  Note: this may not exactly match the number of VGPRs requested by the compiler due to allocation granularity.
  - [VGPRs](valu)
* - AGPRs
  - The number of accumulation vector general-purpose registers allocated for the kernel, see [AGPRs](agprs).  Note: this may not exactly match the number of AGPRs requested by the compiler due to allocation granularity.
  - [AGPRs](agprs)
* - SGPRs
  - The number of scalar general-purpose registers allocated for the kernel, see [SALU](salu).  Note: this may not exactly match the number of SGPRs requested by the compiler due to allocation granularity.
  - [SGPRs](salu)
* - LDS Allocation
  - The number of bytes of [LDS](lds) memory (a.k.a., "Shared" memory) allocated for this kernel.  Note: This may also be larger than what was requested at compile-time due to both allocation granularity and dynamic per-dispatch LDS allocations.
  - Bytes per [workgroup](workgroup)
* - Scratch Allocation
  - The number of bytes of [scratch-memory](Mspace) requested _per_ work-item for this kernel.  Scratch memory is used for stack memory on the accelerator, as well as for register spills/restores.
  - Bytes per [work-item](workitem)
```

(Wavefront_runtime_stats)=
##### Wavefront Runtime Stats

The wavefront runtime statistics gives a high-level overview of the execution of wavefronts in a kernel:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 18 65 17 
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - [Kernel Time](KernelTime)
  - The total duration of the executed kernel.  Note: this should not be directly compared to the wavefront cycles / timings below.
  - Nanoseconds
* - [Kernel Cycles](KernelCycles)
  - The total duration of the executed kernel in cycles.  Note: this should not be directly compared to the wavefront cycles / timings below.
  - Cycles
* - Instructions per wavefront
  - The average number of instructions (of all types) executed per wavefront.  This is averaged over all wavefronts in a kernel dispatch.
  - Instructions / wavefront
* - Wave Cycles
  - The number of cycles a wavefront in the kernel dispatch spent resident on a compute unit per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This is averaged over all wavefronts in a kernel dispatch.  Note: this should not be directly compared to the kernel cycles above.
  - Cycles per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Dependency Wait Cycles
  - The number of cycles a wavefront in the kernel dispatch stalled waiting on memory of any kind (e.g., instruction fetch, vector or scalar memory, etc.) per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This counter is incremented at every cycle by _all_ wavefronts on a CU stalled at a memory operation.  As such, it is most useful to get a sense of how waves were spending their time, rather than identification of a precise limiter because another wave could be actively executing while a wave is stalled.  The sum of this metric, Issue Wait Cycles and Active Cycles should be equal to the total Wave Cycles metric.
  - Cycles per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Issue Wait Cycles
  - The number of cycles a wavefront in the kernel dispatch was unable to issue an instruction for any reason (e.g., execution pipe back-pressure, arbitration loss, etc.) per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This counter is incremented at every cycle by _all_ wavefronts on a CU unable to issue an instruction.  As such, it is most useful to get a sense of how waves were spending their time, rather than identification of a precise limiter because another wave could be actively executing while a wave is issue stalled.  The sum of this metric, Dependency Wait Cycles and Active Cycles should be equal to the total Wave Cycles metric.
  - Cycles per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Active Cycles
  - The average number of cycles a wavefront in the kernel dispatch was actively executing instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This measurement is made on a per-wavefront basis, and may include (e.g.,) cycles that another wavefront spent actively executing (e.g., on another execution unit) or was stalled.  As such, it is most useful to get a sense of how waves were spending their time, rather than identification of a precise limiter.  The sum of this metric, Issue Wait Cycles and Active Wait Cycles should be equal to the total Wave Cycles metric.
  - Cycles per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Wavefront Occupancy
  - The time-averaged number of wavefronts resident on the accelerator over the lifetime of the kernel. Note: this metric may be inaccurate for short-running kernels (<< 1ms).
  - Wavefronts
```

```{seealso}
As mentioned above, the measurement of kernel cycles and time typically cannot directly be compared to e.g., Wave Cycles.
This is due to two factors: first, the kernel cycles/timings are measured using a counter that is impacted by scheduling overhead, this is particularly noticeable for "short-running" kernels (typically << 1ms) where scheduling overhead forms a significant portion of the overall kernel runtime.
Secondly, the Wave Cycles metric is incremented per-wavefront scheduled to a SIMD every cycle whereas the kernel cycles counter is incremented only once per-cycle when _any_ wavefront is scheduled.
```

(Inst_mix)=
#### Instruction Mix

The instruction mix panel shows a breakdown of the various types of instructions executed by the user's kernel, and which pipelines on the [CU](CU) they were executed on.
In addition, Omniperf reports further information about the breakdown of operation types for the [VALU](valu), vector-memory, and [MFMA](mfma) instructions.

```{note}
All metrics in this section count _instructions issued_, and _not_ the total number of operations executed.
The values reported by these metrics will not change regardless of the execution mask of the wavefront.
We note that even if the execution mask is identically zero (i.e., _no lanes are active_) the instruction will still be counted, as CDNA accelerators still consider these instructions 'issued' see, e.g., [EXECute Mask, Section 3.3 of the CDNA2 ISA Guide](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/instinct-mi200-cdna2-instruction-set-architecture.pdf) for more details.
```

##### Overall Instruction Mix

This panel shows the total number of each type of instruction issued to the [various compute pipelines](ERD) on the [CU](CU).
These are:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - [VALU](valu) Instructions
  - The total number of vector arithmetic logic unit (VALU) operations issued. These are the workhorses of the compute-unit, and are used to execute wide range of instruction types including floating point operations, non-uniform address calculations, transcendental operations, integer operations, shifts, conditional evaluation, etc.
  - Instructions
* - VMEM Instructions
  - The total number of vector memory operations issued.  These include most loads, stores and atomic operations and all accesses to [generic, global, private and texture](Mspace) memory.
  - Instructions

  - The total number of matrix fused multiply-add instructions issued.
  - Instructions
* - [SALU](salu) Instructions
  - The total number of scalar arithmetic logic unit (SALU) operations issued. Typically these are used for (e.g.,) address calculations, literal constants, and other operations that are _provably_ uniform across a wavefront.  Although scalar memory (SMEM) operations are issued by the SALU, they are counted separately in this section.
  - Instructions
* - SMEM Instructions
  - The total number of scalar memory (SMEM) operations issued.  These are typically used for loading kernel arguments, base-pointers and loads from HIP's `__constant__` memory.
  - Instructions
* - [Branch](branch) Instructions
  - The total number of branch operations issued.  These typically consist of jump / branch operations and are used to implement control flow.
  - Instructions
```

```{note}
Note, as mentioned in the [Branch](branch) section: branch operations are not used for execution mask updates, but only for "whole wavefront" control-flow changes.
```

##### VALU Arithmetic Instruction Mix
```{warning}
Not all metrics in this section (e.g., the floating-point instruction breakdowns) are available on CDNA accelerators older than the [MI2XX](2xxnote) series.
```

This panel details the various types of vector instructions that were issued to the [VALU](valu).

##### VMEM Instruction Mix

This section breaks down the types of vector memory (VMEM) instructions that were issued.

##### MFMA Instruction Mix

```{warning}
The metrics in this section are only available on CDNA2 ([MI2XX](2xxnote)) accelerators and newer.
```

This section details the types of Matrix Fused Multiply-Add ([MFMA](mfma)) instructions that were issued.
Note that [MFMA](mfma) instructions are classified by the type of input data they operate on, and _not_ the data-type the result is accumulated to.

#### Compute Pipeline

(FLOP_count)=
##### FLOP counting conventions

Omniperf's conventions for VALU FLOP counting are as follows:
  - Addition or Multiplication: 1 operation
  - Transcendentals: 1 operation
  - Fused Multiply-Add (FMA): 2 operations

Integer operations (IOPs) do not use this convention. They are counted as a single operation regardless of the instruction type.

```{note}
Packed operations which operate on multiple operands in the same instruction are counted identically to the underlying instruction type.
For example, the `v_pk_add_f32` instruction on [MI2XX](2xxnote), which performs an add operation on two pairs of aligned 32-bit floating-point operands is counted only as a single addition (i.e., 1 operation).
```

As discussed in the [Instruction Mix](Inst_Mix) section, the FLOP/IOP metrics in this section do not take into account the execution mask of the operation, and will report the same value even if the execution mask is identically zero.

For example, a FMA instruction operating on 32-bit floating-point operands (e.g., `v_fma_f32` on a [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerator) would be counted as 128 total FLOPs: 2 operations (due to the instruction type) multiplied by 64 operations (because the wavefront is composed of 64 work-items).

```

(FLOPS)=
##### Arithmetic Operations

This section reports the total number of floating-point and integer operations executed in various precisions.
Unlike the [Compute speed-of-light](Compute_SOL) panel, this section reports both [VALU](valu) and [MFMA](mfma) operations of the same precision (e.g., F32) in the same metric.
Additionally, this panel lets the user control how the data is normalized (i.e., control the [normalization-unit](normunit)), while the speed-of-light panel does not.
For more detail on how operations are counted see the [FLOP counting convention](FLOP_count) section.

```{warning}
As discussed in the [Instruction Mix](Inst_Mix) section, the metrics in this section do not take into account the execution mask of the operation, and will report the same value even if EXEC is identically zero.

(LDS_metrics)=
### Local Data Share (LDS)

#### LDS Speed-of-Light

```{warning}
The theoretical maximum throughput for some metrics in this section are currently computed with the maximum achievable clock frequency, as reported by `rocminfo`, for an accelerator.  This may not be realistic for all workloads.
```

The LDS speed-of-light chart shows a number of key metrics for the [LDS](lds) as a comparison with the peak achievable values of those metrics.
The reader is referred to our previous [LDS](lds) description for a more in-depth view of the hardware.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Utilization
  - Indicates what percent of the kernel's duration the [LDS](lds) was actively executing instructions (including, but not limited to, load, store, atomic and HIP's `__shfl` operations).  Calculated as the ratio of the total number of cycles LDS was active over the [total CU cycles](TotalCUCycles).
  - Percent
* - Access Rate
  - Indicates the percentage of SIMDs in the [VALU](valu){sup}`1` actively issuing LDS instructions, averaged over the lifetime of the kernel. Calculated as the ratio of the total number of cycles spent by the [scheduler](scheduler) issuing [LDS](lds) instructions over the [total CU cycles](TotalCUCycles).
  - Percent
* - Theoretical Bandwidth (% of Peak)
  - Indicates the maximum amount of bytes that _could_ have been loaded from/stored to/atomically updated in the LDS in this kernel, as a percent of the peak LDS bandwidth achievable.  See the [LDS Bandwidth example](lds_bandwidth) for more detail.
  - Percent
* - Bank Conflict Rate
  - Indicates the percentage of active LDS cycles that were spent servicing bank conflicts. Calculated as the ratio of LDS cycles spent servicing bank conflicts over the number of LDS cycles that would have been required to move the same amount of data in an uncontended access.{sup}`2`
  - Percent
```

```{note}
{sup}`1` Here we assume the typical case where the workload evenly distributes LDS operations over all SIMDs in a CU (that is, waves on different SIMDs are executing similar code).
For highly unbalanced workloads, where e.g., one SIMD pair in the CU does not issue LDS instructions at all, this metric is better interpreted as the percentage of SIMDs issuing LDS instructions on [SIMD pairs](lds) that are actively using the LDS, averaged over the lifetime of the kernel.

{sup}`2` The maximum value of the bank conflict rate is less than 100% (specifically: 96.875%), as the first cycle in the [LDS scheduler](lds) is never considered contended.
```

#### Statistics

The [LDS](lds) statistics panel gives a more detailed view of the hardware:

```


(vL1D)=
### Vector L1 Cache (vL1D)

The vector L1 data (vL1D) cache is local to each [compute unit](CU) on the accelerator, and handles vector memory operations issued by a wavefront.
The vL1D cache consists of several components:

  - an address processing unit, also known as the [texture addresser (TA)](TA), which receives commands (e.g., instructions) and write/atomic data from the [Compute Unit](CU), and coalesces them into fewer requests for the cache to process.
  - an address translation unit, also known as the L1 Unified Translation Cache (UTCL1), that translates requests from virtual to physical addresses for lookup in the cache.  The translation unit has an L1 translation lookaside buffer (L1TLB) to reduce the cost of repeated translations.
  - a Tag RAM that looks up whether a requested cache line is already present in the [cache](TC).
  - the result of the Tag RAM lookup is placed in the L1 cache controller for routing to the correct location, e.g., the [L2 Memory Interface](TCP_TCC_Transactions_Detail) for misses or the [Cache RAM](TC) for hits.
  - the Cache RAM, also known as the [texture cache (TC)](TC), stores requested data for potential reuse.  Data returned from the [L2 cache](L2) is placed into the Cache RAM before going down the [data-return path](TD).
  - a backend data processing unit, also known as the [texture data (TD)](TD) that routes data back to the requesting [Compute Unit](CU).

Together, this complex is known as the vL1D, or Texture Cache per Pipe (TCP).
A simplified diagram of the vL1D is presented below:

#### vL1D Speed-of-Light

```{warning}
The theoretical maximum throughput for some metrics in this section are currently computed with the maximum achievable clock frequency, as reported by `rocminfo`, for an accelerator.  This may not be realistic for all workloads.
```

The vL1D's speed-of-light chart shows several key metrics for the vL1D as a comparison with the peak achievable values of those metrics.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Hit Rate
  - The ratio of the number of vL1D cache line requests that hit{sup}`1` in vL1D cache over the total number of cache line requests to the [vL1D Cache RAM](TC).
  - Percent
* - Bandwidth
  - The number of bytes looked up in the vL1D cache as a result of [VMEM](VALU) instructions, as a percent of the peak theoretical bandwidth achievable on the specific accelerator.  The number of bytes is calculated as the number of cache lines requested multiplied by the cache line size.  This value does not consider partial requests, so e.g., if only a single value is requested in a cache line, the data movement will still be counted as a full cache line.
  - Percent
* - Utilization
  - Indicates how busy the [vL1D Cache RAM](TC) was during the kernel execution. The number of cycles where the [vL1D Cache RAM](TC) is actively processing any request divided by the number of cycles where the [vL1D is active](vL1d_activity){sup}`2`
  - Percent
* - Coalescing
  - Indicates how well memory instructions were coalesced by the [address processing unit](TA), ranging from uncoalesced (25\%) to fully coalesced (100\%). The average number of [thread-requests](ThreadRequests) generated per instruction divided by the ideal number of [thread-requests](ThreadRequests) per instruction.
  - Percent
```

(vL1d_activity)=
```{note}
{sup}`1` The vL1D cache on AMD Instinct(tm) MI CDNA accelerators uses a "hit-on-miss" approach to reporting cache hits.
That is, if while satisfying a miss, another request comes in that would hit on the same pending cache line, the subsequent request will be counted as a 'hit'.
Therefore, it is also important to consider the Access Latency metric in the [Cache access metrics](TCP_cache_access_metrics) section when evaluating the vL1D hit rate.

{sup}`2` Omniperf considers the vL1D to be active when any part of the vL1D (excluding the [address-processor](TA) and [data-return](TD) units) are active, e.g., performing a translation, waiting for data, accessing the Tag or Cache RAMs, etc.
```
(TA)=
#### Address Processing Unit or Texture Addresser (TA)

The [vL1D](vL1D)'s address processing unit receives vector memory instructions (commands) along with write/atomic data from a [Compute Unit](CU) and is responsible for coalescing these into requests for lookup in the [vL1D RAM](TC).
The address processor passes information about the commands (coalescing state, destination SIMD, etc.) to the [data processing unit](TD) for use after the requested data has been retrieved.

Omniperf reports several metrics to indicate performance bottlenecks in the address processing unit, which are broken down into a few categories:

  - Busy / stall metrics
  - Instruction counts
  - Spill / Stack metrics

##### Busy / Stall metrics

When executing vector memory instructions, the compute unit must send an address (and in the case of writes/atomics, data) to the address processing unit.  When the frontend cannot accept any more addresses, it must backpressure the wave-issue logic for the VMEM pipe and prevent the issue of a vector memory instruction until a previously issued memory operation has been processed.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Busy
  - Percent of the [total CU cycles](TotalCUCycles) the address processor was busy
  - Percent
* - Address Stall
  - Percent of the [total CU cycles](TotalCUCycles) the address processor was stalled from sending address requests further into the vL1D pipeline
  - Percent
* - Data Stall
  - Percent of the [total CU cycles](TotalCUCycles) the address processor was stalled from sending write/atomic data further into the vL1D pipeline
  - Percent
* - Data-Processor → Address Stall
  - Percent of [total CU cycles](TotalCUCycles) the address processor was stalled waiting to send command data to the [data processor](TD)
  - Percent
```


(TA_inst)=
##### Instruction counts

The address processor also counts instruction types to give the user information on what sorts of memory instructions were executed by the kernel.
These are broken down into a few major categories:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 20 60
:class: noscroll-table
* - Memory type
  - Usage
  - Description
* - Global
  - Global memory
  - Global memory can be seen by all threads from a process.  This includes the local accelerator's DRAM, remote accelerator's DRAM, and the host's DRAM.
* - Generic
  - Dynamic address spaces
  - Generic memory, a.k.a. "flat" memory, is used when the compiler cannot statically prove that a pointer is to memory in one or the other address spaces. The pointer could dynamically point into global, local, constant, or private memory.
* - Private Memory
  - Register spills / Stack memory
  - Private memory, a.k.a. "scratch" memory, is only visible to a particular [work-item](workitem) in a particular [workgroup](workgroup).  On AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators, private memory is used to implement both register spills and stack memory accesses.
```

The address processor counts these instruction types as follows:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 18 65 17
:class: noscroll-table

* - Type
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Global/Generic
  - The total number of global & generic memory instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Global/Generic Read
  - The total number of global & generic memory read instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Global/Generic Write
  - The total number of global & generic memory write instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Global/Generic Atomic
  - The total number of global & generic memory atomic (with and without return) instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Spill/Stack
  - The total number of spill/stack memory instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Spill/Stack Read
  - The total number of spill/stack memory read instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Spill/Stack Write
  - The total number of spill/stack memory write instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Instruction per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Spill/Stack Atomic
  - The total number of spill/stack memory atomic (with and without return) instructions executed on all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit). Typically unused as these memory operations are typically used to implement thread-local storage.
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
```

```{note}
The above is a simplified model specifically for the HIP programming language that does not consider (e.g.,) inline assembly usage, constant memory usage or texture memory.

These categories correspond to:
  - Global/Generic: global and flat memory operations, that are used for Global and Generic memory access.
  - Spill/Stack: buffer instructions which are used on the MI50, MI100, and [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerators for register spills / stack memory.

These concepts are described in more detail in the [memory space section](Mspace) below, while generic memory access is explored in the [generic memory benchmark](flatmembench) section.
```

##### Spill/Stack metrics

Finally, the address processing unit contains a separate coalescing stage for spill/stack memory, and thus reports:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 18 65 17
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Spill/Stack Total Cycles
  - The number of cycles the address processing unit spent working on spill/stack instructions, per [normalization-unit](normunit).

(UTCL1)=
#### L1 Unified Translation Cache (UTCL1)

After a vector memory instruction has been processed/coalesced by the address processing unit of the vL1D, it must be translated from a virtual to physical address.
This process is handled by the L1 Unified Translation Cache (UTCL1).
This cache contains a L1 Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) which stores recently translated addresses to reduce the cost of subsequent re-translations.

Omniperf reports the following L1 TLB metrics:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 18 65 17
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Requests
  - The number of translation requests made to the UTCL1 per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Hits
  - The number of translation requests that hit in the UTCL1, and could be reused, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Hit Ratio
  - The ratio of the number of translation requests that hit in the UTCL1 divided by the total number of translation requests made to the UTCL1.
  - Percent
* - Translation Misses
  - The total number of translation requests that missed in the UTCL1 due to translation not being present in the cache, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Permission Misses
  - The total number of translation requests that missed in the UTCL1 due to a permission error, per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This is unused and expected to be zero in most configurations for modern CDNA accelerators.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
```
```{note}
On current CDNA accelerators, such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote), the UTCL1 does _not_ count hit-on-miss requests.
```

(TC)=
#### Vector L1 Cache RAM (TC)

After coalescing in the [address processing unit](TA) of the v1LD, and address translation in the [L1 TLB](UTCL1) the request proceeds to the Cache RAM stage of the pipeline.
Incoming requests are looked up in the cache RAMs using parts of the physical address as a tag.
Hits will be returned through the [data-return path](TD), while misses will routed out to the [L2 Cache](L2) for servicing.

The metrics tracked by the vL1D RAM include:

  - Stall metrics
  - Cache access metrics
  - vL1D-L2 transaction detail metrics

(TCP_cache_stall_metrics)=
##### vL1D cache stall metrics

The vL1D also reports where it is stalled in the pipeline, which may indicate performance limiters of the cache.
A stall in the pipeline may result in backpressuring earlier parts of the pipeline, e.g., a stall on L2 requests may backpressure the wave-issue logic of the [VMEM](VALU) pipe and prevent it from issuing more vector memory instructions until the vL1D's outstanding requests are completed.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Stalled on L2 Data
  - The ratio of the number of cycles where the vL1D is stalled waiting for requested data to return from the [L2 cache](L2) divided by the number of cycles where the [vL1D is active](vL1d_activity).
  - Percent
* - Stalled on L2 Requests
  - The ratio of the number of cycles where the vL1D is stalled waiting to issue a request for data to the [L2 cache](L2) divided by the number of cycles where the [vL1D is active](vL1d_activity).
  - Percent
* - Tag RAM Stall (Read/Write/Atomic)
  - The ratio of the number of cycles where the vL1D is stalled due to Read/Write/Atomic requests with conflicting tags being looked up concurrently, divided by the number of cycles where the [vL1D is active](vL1d_activity).
  - Percent
```

(TCP_cache_access_metrics)=
##### vL1D cache access metrics

The vL1D cache access metrics broadly indicate the type of requests incoming from the [cache frontend](TA), the number of requests that were serviced by the vL1D, and the number & type of outgoing requests to the [L2 cache](L2).  In addition, this section includes the approximate latencies of accesses to the cache itself, along with latencies of read/write memory operations to the [L2 cache](L2).

```{list-table}

  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Cache Bandwidth
  - The number of bytes looked up in the vL1D cache as a result of [VMEM](VALU) instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit).  The number of bytes is calculated as the number of cache lines requested multiplied by the cache line size.  This value does not consider partial requests, so e.g., if only a single value is requested in a cache line, the data movement will still be counted as a full cache line.
  - Bytes per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Cache Hit Rate
  - The ratio of the number of vL1D cache line requests that hit in vL1D cache over the total number of cache line requests to the [vL1D Cache RAM](TC).

  - The total number of cache line lookups in the vL1D.
  - Cache lines
* - Cache Hits
  - The number of cache accesses minus the number of outgoing requests to the [L2 cache](L2), i.e., the number of cache line requests serviced by the [vL1D Cache RAM](TC) per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Cache lines per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Invalidations
  - The number of times the vL1D was issued a write-back invalidate command during the kernel's execution per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This may be triggered by, e.g., the `buffer_wbinvl1` instruction.
  - Invalidations per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - L1-L2 Bandwidth
  - The number of bytes transferred across the vL1D-L2 interface as a result of [VMEM](VALU) instructions, per [normalization-unit](normunit).  The number of bytes is calculated as the number of cache lines requested multiplied by the cache line size.  This value does not consider partial requests, so e.g., if only a single value is requested in a cache line, the data movement will still be counted as a full cache line.
  - Bytes per [normalization-unit](normunit)

  - The number of read requests for a vL1D cache line that were not satisfied by the vL1D and must be retrieved from the to the [L2 Cache](L2) per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)

  - The average number of cycles that the vL1D cache took to issue and receive acknowledgement of a write request to the [L2 Cache](L2).  This number also includes requests for atomics without return values.
  - Cycles
```

```{note}
All cache accesses in vL1D are for a single cache line's worth of data.
The size of a cache line may vary, however on current AMD Instinct(tm) MI CDNA accelerators and GCN GPUs the L1 cache line size is 64B.
```

(TCP_TCC_Transactions_Detail)=
##### vL1D - L2 Transaction Detail

This section provides a more granular look at the types of requests made to the [L2 cache](L2).
These are broken down by the operation type (read / write / atomic, with, or without return), and the [memory type](Mtype).
For more detail, the reader is referred to the [Memory Types](Mtype) section.


(TD)=
#### Vector L1 Data-Return Path or Texture Data (TD)

The data-return path of the vL1D cache, also known as the Texture Data (TD) unit, is responsible for routing data returned from the [vL1D cache RAM](TC) back to a wavefront on a SIMD.
As described in the [vL1D cache front-end](TA) section, the data-return path is passed information about the space requirements and routing for data requests from the [VALU](valu).
When data is returned from the [vL1D cache RAM](TC), it is matched to this previously stored request data, and returned to the appropriate SIMD.

Omniperf reports the following vL1D data-return path metrics:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 18 65 17
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit

This is expected to be the sum of global/generic and spill/stack reads in the [address processor](TA_inst).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Write Instructions
  - The number of store instructions submitted to the [data-return unit](TD) by the [address-processor](TA) summed over all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This is expected to be the sum of global/generic and spill/stack stores counted by the [vL1D cache-frontend](TA_inst).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Atomic Instructions
  - The number of atomic instructions submitted to the [data-return unit](TD) by the [address-processor](TA) summed over all [compute units](CU) on the accelerator, per [normalization-unit](normunit).  This is expected to be the sum of global/generic and spill/stack atomics in the [address processor](TA_inst).
  - Instructions per [normalization-unit](normunit)
```

(L2)=
## L2 Cache (TCC)

The L2 cache is the coherence point for current AMD Instinct(tm) MI GCN GPUs and CDNA accelerators, and is shared by all [compute units](CU) on the device.
Besides serving requests from the [vector L1 data caches](vL1D), the L2 cache also is responsible for servicing requests from the [L1 instruction caches](L1I), the [scalar L1 data caches](sL1D) and the [command-processor](CP).
The L2 cache is composed of a number of distinct channels (32 on MI100/[MI2XX](2xxnote) series CDNA accelerators at 256B address interleaving) which can largely operate independently.
Mapping of incoming requests to a specific L2 channel is determined by a hashing mechanism that attempts to evenly distribute requests across the L2 channels.
Requests that miss in the L2 cache are passed out to [Infinity Fabric(tm)](l2fabric) to be routed to the appropriate memory location.

The L2 cache metrics reported by Omniperf are broken down into four categories:

  - L2 Speed-of-Light
  - L2 Cache Accesses
  - L2-Fabric Transactions
  - L2-Fabric Stalls


(L2SoL)=
### L2 Speed-of-Light

```{warning}
The theoretical maximum throughput for some metrics in this section are currently computed with the maximum achievable clock frequency, as reported by `rocminfo`, for an accelerator.  This may not be realistic for all workloads.
```

The L2 cache's speed-of-light table contains a few key metrics about the performance of the L2 cache, aggregated over all the L2 channels, as a comparison with the peak achievable values of those metrics:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 65 15
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Utilization
  - The ratio of the [number of cycles an L2 channel was active, summed over all L2 channels on the accelerator](TotalActiveL2Cycles) over the [total L2 cycles](TotalL2Cycles).
  - Percent
* - Bandwidth
  - The number of bytes looked up in the L2 cache, as a percent of the peak theoretical bandwidth achievable on the specific accelerator.  The number of bytes is calculated as the number of cache lines requested multiplied by the cache line size.  This value does not consider partial requests, so e.g., if only a single value is requested in a cache line, the data movement will still be counted as a full cache line.
  - Percent
* - Hit Rate
  - The ratio of the number of L2 cache line requests that hit in the L2 cache over the total number of incoming cache line requests to the L2 cache.
  - Percent
* - L2-Fabric Read BW
  - The number of bytes read by the L2 over the [Infinity Fabric(tm) interface](l2fabric) per unit time.
  - GB/s
* - L2-Fabric Write and Atomic BW
  - The number of bytes sent by the L2 over the [Infinity Fabric(tm) interface](l2fabric) by write and atomic operations per unit time.
  - GB/s
```

```{note}
The L2 cache on AMD Instinct(tm) MI CDNA accelerators uses a "hit-on-miss" approach to reporting cache hits.
That is, if while satisfying a miss, another request comes in that would hit on the same pending cache line, the subsequent request will be counted as a 'hit'.
Therefore, it is also important to consider the latency metric in the [L2-Fabric](l2fabric) section when evaluating the L2 hit rate.
```

(L2_cache_metrics)=
### L2 Cache Accesses

This section details the incoming requests to the L2 cache from the [vL1D](vL1D) and other clients (e.g., the [sL1D](sL1D) and [L1I](L1I) caches).

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 13 70 17
:class: noscroll-table
* - Metric
  - Description
  - Unit
* - Bandwidth
  - The number of bytes looked up in the L2 cache, per [normalization-unit](normunit).  The number of bytes is calculated as the number of cache lines requested multiplied by the cache line size.  This value does not consider partial requests, so e.g., if only a single value is requested in a cache line, the data movement will still be counted as a full cache line.
  - Bytes per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Requests
  - The total number of incoming requests to the L2 from all clients for all request types, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Read Requests
  - The total number of read requests to the L2 from all clients.

  - The total number of atomic requests (with and without return) to the L2 from all clients.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Streaming Requests
  - The total number of incoming requests to the L2 that are marked as 'streaming'. The exact meaning of this may differ depending on the targeted accelerator, however on an [MI2XX](2xxnote) this corresponds to [non-temporal load or stores](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#non-temporal-load-store-builtins). The L2 cache attempts to evict 'streaming' requests before normal requests when the L2 is at capacity.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Probe Requests
  - The number of coherence probe requests made to the L2 cache from outside the accelerator.  On an [MI2XX](2xxnote), probe requests may be generated by e.g., writes to [fine-grained device](MType) memory or by writes to [coarse-grained](MType) device memory.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Hit Rate
  - The ratio of the number of L2 cache line requests that hit in the L2 cache over the total number of incoming cache line requests to the L2 cache.
  - Percent
* - Hits
  - The total number of requests to the L2 from all clients that hit in the cache.  As noted in the [speed-of-light](L2SoL) section, this includes hit-on-miss requests.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Misses
  - The total number of requests to the L2 from all clients that miss in the cache.  As noted in the [speed-of-light](L2SoL) section, these do not include hit-on-miss requests.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Writebacks
  - The total number of L2 cache lines written back to memory for any reason. Write-backs may occur due to e.g., user-code (e.g., HIP kernel calls to `__threadfence_system`, or atomic built-ins), by the [command-processor](CP)'s memory acquire/release fences, or for other internal hardware reasons.
  - Cache lines per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Writebacks (Internal)
  - The total number of L2 cache lines written back to memory for internal hardware reasons, per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Cache lines per [normalization-unit](normunit)

  - Cache lines per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Evictions (Normal)
  - The total number of L2 cache lines evicted from the cache due to capacity limits, per [normalization-unit](normunit), per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Cache lines per [normalization-unit](normunit)

  - The total number of requests to the L2 that to uncached (UC) memory allocations.  See the [Memory Types section](Mtype) for more detail.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Coherently Cached Requests
  - The total number of requests to the L2 that to coherently cachable (CC) memory allocations.  See the [Memory Types section](Mtype) for more detail.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - Read/Write Coherent Requests
  - The total number of requests to the L2 that to Read-Write coherent memory (RW) allocations.  See the [Memory Types section](Mtype) for more detail.
  - Requests per [normalization-unit](normunit)
```

```{note}
All requests to the L2 are for a single cache line's worth of data.
The size of a cache line may vary depending on the accelerator, however on an AMD Instinct(tm) CDNA2 [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerator, it is 128B, while on an MI100, it is 64B.
```

(l2fabric)=
### L2-Fabric transactions

Requests/data that miss in the L2 must be routed to memory in order to service them.
The backing memory for a request may be local to this accelerator (i.e., in the local high-bandwidth memory), in a remote accelerator's memory, or even in the CPU's memory.
Infinity Fabric(tm) is responsible for routing these memory requests/data to the correct location and returning any fetched data to the L2 cache.
The [following section](L2_req_flow) describes the flow of these requests through Infinity Fabric(tm) in more detail, as described by Omniperf metrics, while [later sections](L2_req_metrics) give detailed definitions of individual metrics.

(L2_req_flow)=
#### Request flow

Below is a diagram that illustrates how L2↔Fabric requests are reported by Omniperf:


```{figure} images/fabric.png
:alt: L2↔Fabric transaction flow on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
:align: center
:name: fabric-fig

L2↔Fabric transaction flow on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
```

Requests from the L2 Cache are broken down into two major categories, read requests and write requests (at this granularity, atomic requests are treated as writes).

From there, these requests can additionally subdivided in a number of ways.
First, these requests may be sent across Infinity Fabric(tm) as different transaction sizes, 32B or 64B on current CDNA accelerators.

```{note}
On current CDNA accelerators, the 32B read request path is expected to be unused (hence: is disconnected in the flow diagram).
```

In addition, the read and write requests can be further categorized as:
  - uncached read/write requests, e.g., for accesses to [fine-grained memory](Mtype)
  - atomic requests, e.g., for atomic updates to [fine-grained memory](Mtype)
  - HBM read/write requests OR remote read/write requests, i.e., for requests to the accelerator's local HBM OR requests to a remote accelerator's HBM / the CPU's DRAM.

These classifications are not necessarily _exclusive_, for example, a write request can be classified as an atomic request to the accelerator's local HBM, and an uncached write request.
The request-flow diagram marks _exclusive_ classifications as a splitting of the flow, while _non-exclusive_ requests do not split the flow line.
For example, a request is either a 32B Write Request OR a 64B Write request, as the flow splits at this point:
```{figure} images/split.*
:scale: 50 %
:alt: Request flow splitting
:align: center
:name: split-request-flow-fig

Splitting request flow
```
However, continuing along, the same request might be an Atomic request and an Uncached Write request, as reflected by a non-split flow:
```{figure} images/nosplit.*
:scale: 50 %
:alt: Request flow splitting
:align: center
:name: nosplit-request-flow-fig

Non-splitting request flow
```

Finally, we note that [uncached](Mtype) read requests (e.g., to [fine-grained memory](Mtype)) are handled specially on CDNA accelerators, as indicated in the request flow diagram.
These are expected to be counted as a 64B Read Request, and _if_ they are requests to uncached memory (denoted by the dashed line), they will also be counted as _two_ uncached read requests (i.e., the request is split):

```{figure} images/uncached.*
:scale: 50 %
:alt: Uncached read-request splitting
:align: center
:name: uncached-read-request-flow-fig

Uncached read-request splitting.
```

#### Metrics


The following metrics are reported for the L2-Fabric interface:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 18 65 17

* - L2-Fabric Read Bandwidth
  - The total number of bytes read by the L2 cache from Infinity Fabric(tm) per [normalization-unit](normunit).
  - Bytes per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - HBM Read Traffic
  - The percent of read requests generated by the L2 cache that are routed to the accelerator's local high-bandwidth memory (HBM).  This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric Read bandwidth directed to the local HBM.
  - Percent
* - Remote Read Traffic
  - The percent of read requests generated by the L2 cache that are routed to any memory location other than the accelerator's local high-bandwidth memory (HBM) --- e.g., the CPU's DRAM, a remote accelerator's HBM, etc. This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric Read bandwidth directed to a remote location.
  - Percent
* - Uncached Read Traffic
  - The percent of read requests generated by the L2 cache that are reading from an [uncached memory allocation](Mtype).  Note, as described in the [request-flow](L2_req_flow) section, a single 64B read request is typically counted as two uncached read requests, hence it is possible for the Uncached Read Traffic to reach up to 200% of the total number of read requests.  This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric read bandwidth directed to an uncached memory location.
  - Percent
* - L2-Fabric Write and Atomic Bandwidth
  - The total number of bytes written by the L2 over Infinity Fabric(tm) by write and atomic operations per [normalization-unit](normunit). Note that on current CDNA accelerators, such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote), requests are only considered 'atomic' by Infinity Fabric(tm) if they are targeted at non-write-cachable memory, e.g., [fine-grained memory](Mtype) allocations or [uncached memory](Mtype) allocations on the [MI2XX](2xxnote).
  - Bytes per [normalization-unit](normunit)
* - HBM Write and Atomic Traffic
  - The percent of write and atomic requests generated by the L2 cache that are routed to the accelerator's local high-bandwidth memory (HBM).  This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric Write and Atomic bandwidth directed to the local HBM. Note that on current CDNA accelerators, such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote), requests are only considered 'atomic' by Infinity Fabric(tm) if they are targeted at [fine-grained memory](Mtype) allocations or [uncached memory](Mtype) allocations.
  - Percent
* - Remote Write and Atomic Traffic
  - The percent of write and atomic requests generated by the L2 cache that are routed to any memory location other than the accelerator's local high-bandwidth memory (HBM) --- e.g., the CPU's DRAM, a remote accelerator's HBM, etc.  This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric Write and Atomic bandwidth directed to a remote location. Note that on current CDNA accelerators, such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote), requests are only considered 'atomic' by Infinity Fabric(tm) if they are targeted at non-write-cachable memory, e.g., [fine-grained memory](Mtype) allocations or [uncached memory](Mtype) allocations on the [MI2XX](2xxnote).
  - Percent
* - Atomic Traffic
  - The percent of write requests generated by the L2 cache that are atomic requests to _any_ memory location.  This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric Write and Atomic bandwidth that is due to use of atomics. Note that on current CDNA accelerators, such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote), requests are only considered 'atomic' by Infinity Fabric(tm) if they are targeted at [fine-grained memory](Mtype) allocations or [uncached memory](Mtype) allocations.
  - Percent
* - Uncached Write and Atomic Traffic
  - The percent of write and atomic requests generated by the L2 cache that are targeting [uncached memory allocations](Mtype).  This breakdown does not consider the _size_ of the request (i.e., 32B and 64B requests are both counted as a single request), so this metric only _approximates_ the percent of the L2-Fabric read bandwidth directed to uncached memory allocations.

### L2-Fabric Interface Stalls

When the interface between the L2 cache and Infinity Fabric(tm) becomes backed up by requests, it may stall preventing the L2 from issuing additional requests to Infinity Fabric(tm) until prior requests complete.
This section gives a breakdown of what types of requests in a kernel caused a stall (e.g., read vs write), and to which locations (e.g., to the accelerator's local memory, or to remote accelerators/CPUs).

```{note}
{sup}`1` In addition to being used for on-accelerator data-traffic, AMD [Infinity Fabric](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/infinity-architecture)(tm) technology can be used to connect multiple accelerators to achieve advanced peer-to-peer connectivity and enhanced bandwidths over traditional PCIe(r) connections.
Some AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators, e.g., the MI250X, [feature coherent CPU↔accelerator connections built using AMD Infinity Fabric(tm)](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/amd-cdna2-white-paper.pdf)
```

```{warning}
On current CDNA accelerators and GCN GPUs, these L2↔Fabric stalls can be undercounted in some circumstances.
```

(SE)=
## Shader Engine (SE)

The [CUs](CU) on a CDNA accelerator are grouped together into a higher-level organizational unit called a Shader Engine (SE):

```{figure} images/selayout.png
:alt: Example of CU-grouping into shader-engines on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
:align: center
:name: selayout-fig

Example of CU-grouping into shader-engines on AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
```

The number of CUs on a SE varies from chip-to-chip (see, for example [AMD GPU HIP Training](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AMD_GPU_HIP_training_20190906.pdf), slide 20).
In addition, newer accelerators such as the AMD Instinct(tm) MI 250X have 8 SEs per accelerator.

For the purposes of Omniperf, we consider resources that are shared between multiple CUs on a single SE as part of the SE's metrics.
These include:
  - the [scalar L1 data cache](sL1D)
  - the [L1 instruction cache](L1I)
  - the [workgroup manager](SPI)

(sL1D)=
### Scalar L1 Data Cache (sL1D)

The Scalar L1 Data cache (sL1D) can cache data accessed from scalar load instructions (and scalar store instructions on architectures where they exist) from wavefronts in the [CUs](CU).
The sL1D is shared between multiple CUs ([GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 36) --- the exact number of CUs depends on the architecture in question (3 CUs in GCN GPUs and MI100, 2 CUs in [MI2XX](2xxnote)) --- and is backed by the [L2](L2) cache.

In typical usage, the data in the sL1D is comprised of (e.g.,):
  - Kernel arguments, e.g., pointers, [non-populated](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table) grid/block dimensions, etc.
  - HIP's `__constant__` memory, when accessed in a provably uniform{sup}`1` manner
  - Other memory, when accessed in a provably uniform manner, *and* the backing memory is provably constant{sup}`1`

```{note}
{sup}`1`
The scalar data cache is used when the compiler emits scalar loads to access data.
This requires that the data be _provably_ uniformly accessed (i.e., the compiler can verify that all work-items in a wavefront access the same data), _and_ that the data can be proven to be read-only (e.g., HIP's `__constant__` memory, or properly `__restrict__`'ed pointers to avoid write-aliasing).
Access of e.g., `__constant__` memory is not guaranteed to go through the sL1D if, e.g., the wavefront loads a non-uniform value.

(SPI)=
### Workgroup manager (SPI)

The workgroup manager (SPI) is the bridge between the [command processor](CP) and the [compute units](CU).
After the [command processor](cp) processes a kernel dispatch, it will then pass the dispatch off to the workgroup manager, which then schedules [workgroups](workgroup) onto the [compute units](CU).
As workgroups complete execution and resources become available, the workgroup manager will schedule new workgroups onto [compute units](CU).
The workgroup manager's metrics therefore are focused on reporting, e.g.:

  - Utilizations of various parts of the accelerator that the workgroup manager interacts with (and the workgroup manager itself)
  - How many workgroups were dispatched, their size, and how many resources they used
  - Percent of scheduler opportunities (cycles) where workgroups failed to dispatch, and
  - Percent of scheduler opportunities (cycles) where workgroups failed to dispatch due to lack of a specific resource on the CUs (e.g., too many VGPRs allocated)

This gives the user an idea of why the workgroup manager couldn't schedule more wavefronts onto the device, and is most useful for workloads that the user suspects to be scheduling/launch-rate limited.

As discussed in the [command processor](cp) description, the command processor on AMD Instinct(tm) MI architectures contains four hardware scheduler-pipes, each with eight software threads ([“Vega10” - Mantor](https://old.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc29/HC29.21-Monday-Pub/HC29.21.10-GPU-Gaming-Pub/HC29.21.120-Radeon-Vega10-Mantor-AMD-f1.pdf), slide 19).
Each scheduler-pipe can issue a kernel dispatch to the workgroup manager to schedule concurrently.
Therefore, some workgroup manager metrics are presented relative to the utilization of these scheduler-pipes (e.g., whether all four are issuing concurrently).

```{note}
Current versions of the profiling libraries underlying Omniperf attempt to serialize concurrent kernels running on the accelerator, as the performance counters on the device are global (i.e., shared between concurrent kernels).
This means that these scheduler-pipe utilization metrics are expected to reach e.g., a maximum of one pipe active, i.e., only 25\%.
```

#### Workgroup Manager Utilizations

#### Workgroup Manager - Resource Allocation

This panel gives more detail on how workgroups/wavefronts were scheduled onto compute units, and what occupancy limiters they hit (if any).
When analyzing these metrics, the user should also take into account their achieved occupancy (i.e., [Wavefront occupancy](Wavefront_runtime_stats)).
A kernel may be occupancy limited by e.g., LDS usage, but may still achieve high occupancy levels such that improving occupancy further may not improve performance.
See the [Workgroup Manager - Occupancy Limiters](Occupancy_example) example for more details.

(CP)=
## Command Processor (CP)

The command processor -- a.k.a., the CP -- is responsible for interacting with the AMDGPU Kernel Driver (a.k.a., the Linux Kernel) on the CPU and for interacting with user-space HSA clients when they submit commands to HSA queues.
Basic tasks of the CP include reading commands (e.g., corresponding to a kernel launch) out of [HSA Queues](http://hsafoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HSA-Runtime-1.2.pdf) (Sec. 2.5), scheduling work to subsequent parts of the scheduler pipeline, and marking kernels complete for synchronization events on the host.

The command processor is composed of two sub-components:

  - Fetcher (CPF): Fetches commands out of memory to hand them over to the CPC for processing
  - Packet Processor (CPC): The micro-controller running the command processing firmware that decodes the fetched commands, and (for kernels) passes them to the [Workgroup Processors](SPI) for scheduling

Before scheduling work to the accelerator, the command-processor can first acquire a memory fence to ensure system consistency [(Sec 2.6.4)](http://hsafoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HSA-Runtime-1.2.pdf).
After the work is complete, the command-processor can apply a memory-release fence.
Depending on the AMD CDNA accelerator under question, either of these operations _may_ initiate a cache write-back or invalidation.

Analyzing command processor performance is most interesting for kernels that the user suspects to be scheduling/launch-rate limited.
The command processor's metrics therefore are focused on reporting, e.g.:

  - Utilization of the fetcher
  - Utilization of the packet processor, and decoding processing packets
  - Fetch/processing stalls

## System Speed-of-Light

```{warning}
The theoretical maximum throughput for some metrics in this section are currently computed with the maximum achievable clock frequency, as reported by `rocminfo`, for an accelerator.  This may not be realistic for all workloads.

In addition, not all metrics (e.g., FLOP counters) are available on all AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators.
For more detail on how operations are counted, see the [FLOP counting convention](FLOP_count) section.

(normunit)=
## Normalization units

A user-configurable unit by which the user can choose to normalize data.  Choices include:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 80
:class: noscroll-table
* - Name
  - Description
* - `per_cycle`
  - The total value of the measured counter/metric that occurred per kernel invocation divided by the [Kernel Cycles](KernelCycles), i.e., total number of cycles the kernel executed as measured by the [Command Processor](CP).
* - `per_wave`
  - The total value of the measured counter/metric that occurred per kernel invocation divided by the total number of [wavefronts](wavefront) launched in the kernel.
* - `per_kernel`
  - The total value of the measured counter/metric that occurred per kernel invocation.
* - `per_second`
  - The total value of the measured counter/metric that occurred per kernel invocation divided by the [Kernel Time](KernelTime), i.e., the total runtime of the kernel in seconds, as measured by the [Command Processor](CP).
```

By default, Omniperf uses the `per_wave` normalization. The appropriate normalization will vary depending on your use case.
For instance, a `per_second` normalization may be useful for FLOP or bandwidth comparisons, while a `per_wave` normalization may be useful (e.g.,) to see how many (and what types) of instructions are used per wavefront, and a `per_kernel` normalization may be useful to get the total aggregate values of metrics for comparison between different configurations.

(Mspace)=
## Memory Spaces

AMD Instinct(tm) MI accelerators can access memory through multiple address spaces which may map to different physical memory locations on the system.
The [table below](mspace-table) provides a view of how various types of memory used in HIP map onto these constructs:

```{list-table} Memory / Address space terminology

Below is a high-level description of the address spaces in the AMDGPU backend of LLVM:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 80
:class: noscroll-table

* - Address space
  - Description
* - Global
  - Memory that can be seen by all threads in a process, and may be backed by the local accelerator's HBM, a remote accelerator's HBM, or the CPU's DRAM.
* - Local
  - Memory that is only visible to a particular workgroup.  On AMD's Instinct(tm) accelerator hardware, this is stored in [LDS](LDS) memory.
* - Private
  - Memory that is only visible to a particular [work-item](workitem) (thread), stored in the scratch space on AMD's Instinct(tm) accelerators.
* - Constant
  - Read-only memory that is in the global address space and stored on the local accelerator's HBM.
* - Generic
  - Used when the compiler cannot statically prove that a pointer is addressing memory in a single (non-generic) address space. Mapped to Flat on AMD's Instinct(tm) accelerators, the pointer could dynamically address global, local, private or constant memory.
```

[LLVM's documentation for AMDGPU Backend](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#address-spaces) will always have the most up-to-date information, and the interested reader is referred to this source for a more complete explanation.

(Mtype)=
## Memory Type

AMD Instinct(tm) accelerators contain a number of different memory allocation types to enable the HIP language's [memory coherency model](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/user_guide/programming_manual.html#coherency-controls).
These memory types are broadly similar between AMD Instinct(tm) accelerator generations, but may differ in exact implementation.

In addition, these memory types _may_ differ between accelerators on the same system, even when accessing the same memory allocation.
For example, an [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerator accessing "fine-grained" memory allocated local to that device may see the allocation as coherently cachable, while a remote accelerator might see the same allocation as uncached.

These memory types include:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 80
:class: noscroll-table
  * - Memory type
    - Description
  * - Uncached Memory (UC)
    - Memory that will not be cached in this accelerator.  On [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerators, this corresponds "fine-grained" (a.k.a., "coherent") memory allocated on a remote accelerator or the host, e.g., using `hipHostMalloc` or `hipMallocManaged` with default allocation flags.
  * - Non-hardware-Coherent Memory (NC)
    - Memory that will be cached by the accelerator, and is only guaranteed to be consistent at kernel boundaries / after software-driven synchronization events. On [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerators, this type of memory maps to (e.g.,) "coarse-grained" `hipHostMalloc`'d memory (i.e., allocated with the `hipHostMallocNonCoherent` flag), or `hipMalloc`'d memory allocated on a remote accelerator.
  * - Coherently Cachable (CC)
    - Memory for which only reads from the accelerator where the memory was allocated will be cached.  Writes to CC memory are uncached, and trigger invalidations of any line within this accelerator. On [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerators, this type of memory maps to "fine-grained" memory allocated on the local accelerator using, e.g., the `hipExtMallocWithFlags` API using the `hipDeviceMallocFinegrained` flag.
  * - Read/Write Coherent Memory (RW)
    - Memory that will be cached by the accelerator, but may be invalidated by writes from remote devices at kernel boundaries / after software-driven synchronization events. On [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerators, this corresponds to "coarse-grained" memory allocated locally to the accelerator, using e.g., the default `hipMalloc` allocator.
```

A good discussion of coarse and fine grained memory allocations and what type of memory is returned by various combinations of memory allocators, flags and arguments can be found in the [Crusher Quick-Start Guide](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/crusher_quick_start_guide.html#floating-point-fp-atomic-operations-and-coarse-fine-grained-memory-allocations). 

(profiling-with-omniperf)=
# Profiling with Omniperf by Example

(VALU_inst_mix_example)=
## VALU Arithmetic Instruction Mix

For this example, we consider the [instruction mix sample](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/instmix.hip) distributed as a part of Omniperf.

```{note}
This example is expected to work on all CDNA accelerators, however the results in this section were collected on an [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerator
```

### Design note

This code uses a number of inline assembly instructions to cleanly identify the types of instructions being issued, as well as to avoid optimization / dead-code elimination by the compiler.
While inline assembly is inherently unportable, this example is expected to work on all GCN GPUs and CDNA accelerators.

We reproduce a sample of the kernel below:

```c++
  // fp32: add, mul, transcendental and fma
  float f1, f2;
  asm volatile(
      "v_add_f32_e32 %0, %1, %0\n"
      "v_mul_f32_e32 %0, %1, %0\n"
      "v_sqrt_f32 %0, %1\n"
      "v_fma_f32 %0, %1, %0, %1\n"
      : "=v"(f1)
      : "v"(f2));
```

These instructions correspond to:
  - A 32-bit floating point addition,
  - A 32-bit floating point multiplication,
  - A 32-bit floating point square-root transcendental operation, and
  - A 32-bit floating point fused multiply-add operation.

For more detail, the reader is referred to (e.g.,) the [CDNA2 ISA Guide](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/instinct-mi200-cdna2-instruction-set-architecture.pdf).

### Instruction mix

This example was compiled and run on a MI250 accelerator using ROCm v5.6.0, and Omniperf v2.0.0.
```shell-session
$ hipcc -O3 instmix.hip -o instmix
```

We generate our profile for this example via:
```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n instmix --no-roof -- ./instmix
```

and finally, analyze the instruction mix section:

## Infinity-Fabric(tm) transactions

For this example, we consider the [Infinity Fabric(tm) sample](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/fabric.hip) distributed as a part of Omniperf.
This code launches a simple read-only kernel, e.g.:

```c++
// the main streaming kernel
__global__ void kernel(int* x, size_t N, int zero) {
  int sum = 0;
  const size_t offset_start = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    for (size_t offset = offset_start; offset < N; offset += blockDim.x * gridDim.x) {
      sum += x[offset];
    }
  }
  if (sum != 0) {
    x[offset_start] = sum;
  }
}
```

twice; once as a warmup, and once for analysis.
We note that the buffer `x` is initialized to all zeros via a call to `hipMemcpy` on the host before the kernel is ever launched, therefore the conditional:

```c++
if (sum != 0) { ...
```

is identically false (and thus: we expect no writes).

```{note}
The actual sample included with Omniperf also includes the ability to select different operation types, e.g., atomics, writes, etc.
This abbreviated version is presented here for reference only.
```

Finally, this sample code lets the user control:
  - The [granularity of an allocation](Mtype),
  - The owner of an allocation (local HBM, CPU DRAM or remote HBM), and
  - The size of an allocation (the default is $\sim4$GiB)

via command line arguments.
In doing so, we can explore the impact of these parameters on the L2-Fabric metrics reported by Omniperf to further understand their meaning.

All results in this section were generated an a node of Infinity Fabric(tm) connected MI250 accelerators using ROCm v5.6.0, and Omniperf v2.0.0.
Although results may vary with ROCm versions and accelerator connectivity, we expect the lessons learned here to be broadly applicable.

```

Here, we see:
  - The vast majority of L2-Fabric requests (>99%) are 64B read requests (17.5.2)
  - Nearly 100% of the read requests (17.2.1) are homed in on the accelerator-local HBM (17.5.3), while some small fraction of these reads are routed to a "remote" device (17.5.4)
  - These drive a $\sim40$GiB per kernel read-bandwidth (17.2.0)

In addition, we see a small amount of [uncached](Mtype) reads (17.5.1), these correspond to things like:
  - the assembly code to execute the kernel
  - kernel arguments
  - coordinate parameters (e.g., blockDim.z) that were not initialized by the hardware, etc.
and may account for some of our 'remote' read requests (17.5.4), e.g., reading from CPU DRAM.

The above list is not exhaustive, nor are all of these guaranteed to be 'uncached' -- the exact implementation depends on the accelerator and ROCm versions used.
These read requests could be interrogated further in the [Scalar L1 Data Cache](sL1D) and [Instruction Cache](L1I) metric sections.

```{note}
The Traffic metrics in Sec 17.2 are presented as a percentage of the total number of requests, e.g. 'HBM Read Traffic' is the percent of read requests (17.5.0-17.5.2) that were directed to the accelerators' local HBM (17.5.3).
```

### Experiment #2 - Fine-grained, accelerator-local HBM reads

In this experiment, we change the [granularity](Mtype) of our device-allocation to be fine-grained device memory, local to the current accelerator.
Our code uses the `hipExtMallocWithFlag` API with the `hipDeviceMallocFinegrained` flag to accomplish this.

```{note}
On some systems (e.g., those with only PCIe(r) connected accelerators), you need to set the environment variable `HSA_FORCE_FINE_GRAIN_PCIE=1` to enable this memory type.
```

Comparing with our [previous example](Fabric_exp_1), we see a relatively similar result, namely:
  - The vast majority of L2-Fabric requests are 64B read requests (17.5.2)
  - Nearly all these read requests are directed to the accelerator-local HBM (17.2.1)

In addition, we now see a small percentage of HBM Read Stalls (17.4.2), as streaming fine-grained memory is putting more stress on Infinity Fabric(tm).

```{note}
The stalls in Sec 17.4 are presented as a percentage of the total number active L2 cycles, summed over [all L2 channels](L2).

### Experiment #3 - Fine-grained, remote-accelerator HBM reads

In this experiment, we move our [fine-grained](Mtype) allocation to be owned by a remote accelerator.
We accomplish this by first changing the HIP device using e.g., `hipSetDevice(1)` API, then allocating fine-grained memory (as described [previously](Fabric_exp_2)), and finally resetting the device back to the default, e.g., `hipSetDevice(0)`.

Although we have not changed our code significantly, we do see a substantial change in the L2-Fabric metrics:

```

First, we see that while we still observe approximately the same number of 64B Read Requests (17.5.2), we now see an even larger number of Uncached Read Requests (17.5.3).  Some simple division reveals:
```math
342177894.00 / 671088949.00 ≈ 2
```
That is, each 64B Read Request is _also_ counted as two Uncached Read Requests, as reflected in the [request-flow diagram](fabric-fig).
This is also why the Uncached Read Traffic metric (17.2.3) is at the counter-intuitive value of 200%!

In addition, we also observe that:
  - we no longer see any significant number of HBM Read Requests (17.2.1, 17.5.3), nor HBM Read Stalls (17.4.2), but instead
  - we observe that almost all of these requests are considered "remote" (17.2.2, 17.5.4) are being routed to another accelerator, or the CPU --- in this case HIP  Device 1 --- and
  - we observe a significantly larger percentage of AMD Infinity Fabric(tm) Read Stalls (17.4.1) as compared to the HBM Read Stalls in the [previous example](Fabric_exp_2)

These stalls correspond to reads that are going out over the AMD Infinity Fabric(tm) connection to another MI250 accelerator.
In addition, because these are crossing between accelerators, we expect significantly lower achievable bandwidths as compared to the local accelerator's HBM -- this is reflected (indirectly) in the magnitude of the stall metric (17.4.1).
Finally, we note that if our system contained only PCIe(r) connected accelerators, these observations will differ.

### Experiment #4 - Fine-grained, CPU-DRAM reads

In this experiment, we move our [fine-grained](Mtype) allocation to be owned by the CPU's DRAM.
We accomplish this by allocating host-pinned fine-grained memory using the `hipHostMalloc` API:

```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n fine_grained_host --no-roof -- ./fabric -t 0 -o 1
Using:
  mtype:FineGrained
  mowner:Host
  mspace:Global
  mop:Read
  mdata:Unsigned
  remoteId:-1
<...>
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/fine_grained_host/mi200 -b 17.2.0 17.2.1 17.2.2 17.2.3 17.4.0 17.4.1 17.4.2 17.5.0 17.5.1 17.5.2 17.5.3 17.5.4  -n per_kernel --dispatch 2

```

Here we see _almost_ the same results as in the [previous experiment](Fabric_exp_3), however now as we are crossing a PCIe(r) bus to the CPU, we see that the Infinity Fabric(tm) Read stalls (17.4.1) have shifted to be a PCIe(r) stall (17.4.2).
In addition, as (on this system) the PCIe(r) bus has a lower peak bandwidth than the AMD Infinity Fabric(TM) connection between two accelerators, we once again observe an increase in the percentage of stalls on this interface.

```{note}
Had we performed this same experiment on a [MI250X system](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/amd-cdna2-white-paper.pdf), these transactions would again have been marked as Infinity Fabric(tm) Read stalls (17.4.1), as the CPU is connected to the accelerator via AMD Infinity Fabric.
```

### Experiment #5 - Coarse-grained, CPU-DRAM reads

In our next fabric experiment, we change our CPU memory allocation to be [coarse-grained](Mtype).
We accomplish this by passing the `hipHostMalloc` API the `hipHostMallocNonCoherent` flag, to mark the allocation as coarse-grained:

```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n coarse_grained_host --no-roof -- ./fabric -t 1 -o 1
Using:
  mtype:CoarseGrained
  mowner:Host

Here we see a similar result to our [previous experiment](Fabric_exp_4), with one key difference: our accesses are no longer marked as Uncached Read requests (17.2.3, 17.5.1), but instead are 64B read requests (17.5.2), as observed in our [Coarse-grained, accelerator-local HBM](Fabric_exp_1) experiment.

### Experiment #6 - Fine-grained, CPU-DRAM writes

Thus far in our exploration of the L2-Fabric interface, we have primarily focused on read operations.
However, in [our request flow diagram](fabric-fig), we note that writes are counted separately.
To obeserve this, we use the '-p' flag to trigger write operations to fine-grained memory allocated on the host:

```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n fine_grained_host_write --no-roof -- ./fabric -t 0 -o 1 -p 1

Here we notice a few changes in our request pattern:
  - As expected, the requests have changed from 64B Reads to 64B Write requests (17.5.7), 
  - these requests are homed in on a "remote" destination (17.2.6, 17.5.9), as expected, and,
  - these are also counted as a single Uncached Write request (17.5.6).

In addition, there rather significant changes in the bandwidth values reported:
  - the "L2-Fabric Write and Atomic" bandwidth metric (17.2.4) reports about 40GiB of data written across Infinity Fabric(tm) while,
  - the "Remote Write and Traffic" metric (17.2.5) indicates that nearly 100% of these request are being directed to a remote source

The precise meaning of these metrics will be explored in the [subsequent experiment](Fabric_exp_7).

Finally, we note that we see no write stalls on the PCIe(r) bus (17.4.3). This is because writes over a PCIe(r) bus [are non-posted](https://members.pcisig.com/wg/PCI-SIG/document/10912), i.e., they do not require acknowledgement.

```

In this case, there is quite a lot to unpack:
  - For the first time, the 32B Write requests (17.5.5) are heavily used.
  - These correspond to Atomic requests (17.2.7, 17.5.10), and are counted as Uncached Writes (17.5.6).
  - The L2-Fabric Write and Atomic bandwidth metric (17.2.4) shows about 0.4 GiB of traffic. For convenience, the sample reduces the default problem size for this case due to the speed of atomics across a PCIe(r) bus, and finally,
  - The traffic is directed to a remote device (17.2.6, 17.5.9)

Let us consider what an "atomic" request means in this context.
Recall that we are discussing memory traffic flowing from the L2 cache, the device-wide coherence point on current CDNA accelerators such as the MI250, to e.g., the CPU's DRAM.
In this light, we see that these requests correspond to _system scope_ atomics, and specifically in the case of the MI250, to fine-grained memory!

<!-- Leave as possible future experiment to add


### Experiment #2 - Non-temporal writes

If we take the same code (for convenience only) as previously described, we can demonstrate how to achieve 'streaming' writes, as described in the [L2 Cache Access metrics](L2_cache_metrics) section.
To see this, we use the Clang built-in [`__builtin_nontemporal_store`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#non-temporal-load-store-builtins), for example

```
template<typename T>
__device__ void store (T* ptr, T val) {
  __builtin_nontemporal_store(val, ptr);
}
```

On an AMD [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerator, for FP32 values this will generate a `global_store_dword` instruction, with the `glc` and `slc` bits set, described in [section 10.1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/CDNA2_Shader_ISA_4February2022.pdf) of the CDNA2 ISA guide.

## Vector memory operation counting

(flatmembench)=
### Global / Generic (FLAT)

For this example, we consider the [vector-memory sample](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/vmem.hip) distributed as a part of Omniperf.
This code launches many different versions of a simple read/write/atomic-only kernels targeting various address spaces, e.g. below is our simple `global_write` kernel:

```c++
// write to a global pointer
__global__ void global_write(int* ptr, int zero) {
  ptr[threadIdx.x] = zero;
}
```

This example was compiled and run on an MI250 accelerator using ROCm v5.6.0, and Omniperf v2.0.0.
```shell-session
$ hipcc -O3 --save-temps vmem.hip -o vmem
```
We have also chosen to include the `--save-temps` flag to save the compiler temporary files, such as the generated CDNA assembly code, for inspection.

Finally, we generate our omniperf profile as:
```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n vmem --no-roof -- ./vmem
```

(Flat_design)=
#### Design note

We should explain some of the more peculiar line(s) of code in our example, e.g., the use of compiler builtins and explicit address space casting, etc.
```c++
// write to a generic pointer
typedef int __attribute__((address_space(0)))* generic_ptr;

__attribute__((noinline)) __device__ void generic_store(generic_ptr ptr, int zero) { *ptr = zero; }

__global__ void generic_write(int* ptr, int zero, int filter) {
  __shared__ int lds[1024];
  int* generic = (threadIdx.x < filter) ? &ptr[threadIdx.x] : &lds[threadIdx.x];
  generic_store((generic_ptr)generic, zero);
}
```

One of our aims in this example is to demonstrate the use of the ['generic' (a.k.a., FLAT)](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#address-space-identifier) address space.
This address space is typically used when the compiler cannot statically prove where the backing memory is located.

To try to _force_ the compiler to use this address space, we have applied `__attribute__((noinline))` to the `generic_store` function to have the compiler treat it as a function call (i.e., on the other-side of which, the address space may not be known).
However, in a trivial example such as this, the compiler may choose to specialize the `generic_store` function to the two address spaces that may provably be used from our translation-unit, i.e., ['local' (a.k.a., LDS)](Mspace) and ['global'](Mspace).  Hence, we forcibly cast the address space to ['generic' (i.e., FLAT)](Mspace) to avoid this compiler optimization.

```{warning}
While convenient for our example here, this sort of explicit address space casting can lead to strange compilation errors, and in the worst cases, incorrect results and thus use is discouraged in production code.
```

For more details on address spaces, the reader is referred to the [address-space section](Mspace).

#### Global Write

First, we demonstrate our simple `global_write` kernel:
```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/vmem/mi200/ --dispatch 1 -b 10.3 15.1.4 15.1.5 15.1.6 15.1.7 15.1.8 15.1.9 15.1.10 15.1.11  -n per_kernel

```

Here, we have presented both the information in the VMEM Instruction Mix table (10.3) and the Address Processing Unit (15.1).
We note that this data is expected to be identical, and hence we omit table 15.1 in our subsequent examples.

In addition, as expected, we see a single Global/Generic write instruction (10.3.2, 15.1.7).
Inspecting the generated assembly:

```asm
        .protected      _Z12global_writePii     ; -- Begin function _Z12global_writePii
        .globl  _Z12global_writePii
        .p2align        8
        .type   _Z12global_writePii,@function
_Z12global_writePii:                    ; @_Z12global_writePii
; %bb.0:
        s_load_dword s2, s[4:5], 0x8
        s_load_dwordx2 s[0:1], s[4:5], 0x0
        v_lshlrev_b32_e32 v0, 2, v0
        s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)
        v_mov_b32_e32 v1, s2
        global_store_dword v0, v1, s[0:1]
        s_endpgm
        .section        .rodata,#alloc
        .p2align        6, 0x0
        .amdhsa_kernel _Z12global_writePii
```

we see that this corresponds to an instance of a `global_store_dword` operation.

```{note}
The assembly in these experiments were generated for an [MI2XX](2xxnote) accelerator using ROCm 5.6.0, and may change depending on ROCm versions and the targeted hardware architecture
```

(Generic_write)=
#### Generic Write to LDS

Next, we examine a generic write.
As discussed [previously](Flat_design), our `generic_write` kernel uses an address space cast to _force_ the compiler to choose our desired address space, regardless of other optimizations that may be possible.

We also note that the `filter` parameter passed in as a kernel argument (see [example](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/vmem.hip), or [design note](Flat_design)) is set to zero on the host, such that we always write to the 'local' (LDS) memory allocation `lds`.

Examining this kernel in the VMEM Instruction Mix table yields:

```

As expected we see a single generic write (10.3.2).
In the assembly generated for this kernel (in particular, we care about the `generic_store` function). We see that this corresponds to a `flat_store_dword` instruction:

```asm
        .type   _Z13generic_storePii,@function
_Z13generic_storePii:                   ; @_Z13generic_storePii
; %bb.0:

        s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) lgkmcnt(0)
        s_setpc_b64 s[30:31]
.Lfunc_end0:
```

In addition, we note that we can observe the destination of this request by looking at the LDS Instructions metric (12.2.0):
```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/vmem/mi200/ --dispatch 2 -b 12.2.0 -n per_kernel

```
which indicates one LDS access.

```{note}
Exercise for the reader: if this access had been targeted at global memory (e.g., by changing value of `filter`), where should we look for the memory traffic?  Hint: see our [generic read](Generic_read) example.
```

#### Global read

Next, we examine a simple global read operation:

```c++
__global__ void global_read(int* ptr, int zero) {
  int x = ptr[threadIdx.x];
  if (x != zero) {
    ptr[threadIdx.x] = x + 1;
  }
}
```

Here we observe a now familiar pattern:
  - Read a value in from global memory
  - Have a write hidden behind a conditional that is impossible for the compiler to statically eliminate, but is identically false. In this case, our `main()` function initializes the data in `ptr` to zero.

Running Omniperf on this kernel yields:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/vmem/mi200/ --dispatch 3 -b 10.3 -n per_kernel

Here we see a single global/generic instruction (10.3.0) which, as expected, is a read (10.3.1).

(Generic_read)=
#### Generic read from global memory

For our generic read example, we choose to change our target for the generic read to be global memory:
```c++
__global__ void generic_read(int* ptr, int zero, int filter) {
  __shared__ int lds[1024];
  if (static_cast<int>(filter - 1) == zero) {
    lds[threadIdx.x] = 0; // initialize to zero to avoid conditional, but hide behind _another_ conditional
  }
  int* generic;
  if (static_cast<int>(threadIdx.x) > filter - 1) {
    generic = &ptr[threadIdx.x];
  } else {
    generic = &lds[threadIdx.x];
    abort();
  }
  int x = generic_load((generic_ptr)generic);
  if (x != zero) {
    ptr[threadIdx.x] = x + 1;
  }
}
```

In addition to our usual `if (condition_that_wont_happen)` guard around the write operation, there is an additional conditional around the initialization of the `lds` buffer.
We note that it's typically required to write to this buffer to prevent the compiler from eliminating the local memory branch entirely due to undefined behavior (use of an uninitialized value).
However, to report _only_ our global memory read, we again hide this initialization behind an identically false conditional (both `zero` and `filter` are set to zero in the kernel launch). Note that this is a _different_ conditional from our pointer assignment (to avoid combination of the two).

```

Here we observe:
  - A single global/generic read operation (10.3.1), which
  - Is not an LDS instruction (12.2), as seen in our [generic write](Generic_write) example, but is instead
  - An L1-L2 read operation (16.3.10)

That is, we have successfully targeted our generic read at global memory.
Inspecting the assembly shows this corresponds to a `flat_load_dword` instruction.

(Global_atomic)=
#### Global atomic

Our global atomic kernel:
```c++
__global__ void global_atomic(int* ptr, int zero) {
  atomicAdd(ptr, zero);
}
```
simply atomically adds a (non-compile-time) zero value to a pointer.

Running Omniperf on this kernel yields:

Here we see a single global/generic atomic instruction (10.3.3), which corresponds to an L1-L2 atomic request (16.3.12).

(Generic_atomic)=
#### Generic, mixed atomic

In our final global/generic example, we look at a case where our generic operation targets both LDS and global memory:
```c++
__global__ void generic_atomic(int* ptr, int filter, int zero) {
  __shared__ int lds[1024];
  int* generic = (threadIdx.x % 2 == filter) ? &ptr[threadIdx.x] : &lds[threadIdx.x];
  generic_atomic((generic_ptr)generic, zero);
}
```

This assigns every other work-item to atomically update global memory or local memory.

That is, we see:
  - A single generic atomic instruction (10.3.3) that maps to both
  - an LDS instruction (12.2.0), and
  - an L1-L2 atomic request (16.3)

We have demonstrated the ability of the generic address space to _dynamically_ target different backing memory!

(buffermembench)=
### Spill/Scratch (BUFFER)

Next we examine the use of 'Spill/Scratch' memory.
On current CDNA accelerators such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote), this is implemented using the [private](mspace) memory space, which maps to ['scratch' memory](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#amdgpu-address-spaces) in AMDGPU hardware terminology.
This type of memory can be accessed via different instructions depending on the specific architecture targeted. However, current CDNA accelerators such as the [MI2XX](2xxnote) use so called `buffer` instructions to access private memory in a simple (and typically) coalesced manner.  See [Sec. 9.1, 'Vector Memory Buffer Instructions' of the CDNA2 ISA guide](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/instinct-mi200-cdna2-instruction-set-architecture.pdf) for further reading on this instruction type.

We develop a [simple kernel](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/stack.hip) that uses stack memory:
```c++
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
__global__ void knl(int* out, int filter) {
  int x[1024];
  x[filter] = 0;
  if (threadIdx.x < filter)
    out[threadIdx.x] = x[threadIdx.x];
}
```

Our strategy here is to:
  - Create a large stack buffer (that cannot reasonably fit into registers)
  - Write to a compile-time unknown location on the stack, and then
  - Behind the typical compile-time unknown `if(condition_that_wont_happen)`
  - Read from a different, compile-time unknown, location on the stack and write to global memory to prevent the compiler from optimizing it out.

This example was compiled and run on an MI250 accelerator using ROCm v5.6.0, and Omniperf v2.0.0.
```shell-session
$ hipcc -O3 stack.hip -o stack.hip
```
and profiled using omniperf:
```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n stack --no-roof -- ./stack
<...>
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/stack/mi200/  -b 10.3 16.3.11 -n per_kernel
<...>

```

Here we see a single write to the stack (10.3.6), which corresponds to an L1-L2 write request (16.3.11), i.e., the stack is backed by global memory and travels through the same memory hierarchy.

(IPC_example)=
## Instructions-per-cycle and Utilizations example

For this section, we use the instructions-per-cycle (IPC) [example](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/ipc.hip) included with Omniperf.

This example is compiled using `c++17` support:

```shell-session
$ hipcc -O3 ipc.hip -o ipc -std=c++17
```

and was run on an MI250 CDNA2 accelerator:

```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n ipc --no-roof -- ./ipc
```

The results shown in this section are _generally_ applicable to CDNA accelerators, but may vary between generations and specific products.

### Design note

The kernels in this example all execute a specific assembly operation `N` times (1000, by default), for instance the `vmov` kernel:

```c++
template<int N=1000>
__device__ void vmov_op() {
    int dummy;
    if constexpr (N >= 1) {
        asm volatile("v_mov_b32 v0, v1\n" : : "{v31}"(dummy));
        vmov_op<N - 1>();
    }
}

template<int N=1000>
__global__ void vmov() {
    vmov_op<N>();
}
```

The kernels are then launched twice, once for a warm-up run, and once for measurement.

(VALU_ipc)=
### VALU Utilization and IPC

Now we can use our test to measure the achieved instructions-per-cycle of various types of instructions.
We start with a simple [VALU](valu) operation, i.e., a `v_mov_b32` instruction, e.g.:

```asm
v_mov_b32 v0, v1
```

This instruction simply copies the contents from the source register (`v1`) to the destination register (`v0`).
Investigating this kernel with Omniperf, we see:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/ipc/mi200/ --dispatch 7 -b 11.2

Here we see that:

  1. Both the IPC (11.2.0) and "Issued" IPC (11.2.1) metrics are $\sim 1$
  2. The VALU Utilization metric (11.2.3) is also $\sim100\%$, and finally
  3. The VALU Active Threads metric (11.2.4) is 64, i.e., the wavefront size on CDNA accelerators, as all threads in the wavefront are active.

We will explore the difference between the IPC (11.2.0) and "Issued" IPC (11.2.1) metrics in the [next section](Issued_ipc).

Additionally, we notice a small (0.1%) Branch utilization (11.2.5).
Inspecting the assembly of this kernel shows there are no branch operations, however recalling the note in the [Pipeline statistics](Pipeline_stats) section:

> the Branch utilization <...> includes time spent in other instruction types (namely: `s_endpgm`) that are _typically_ a very small percentage of the overall kernel execution.

we see that this is coming from execution of the `s_endpgm` instruction at the end of every wavefront.

```{note}
Technically, the cycle counts used in the denominators of our IPC metrics are actually in units of quad-cycles, a group of 4 consecutive cycles.
However, a typical [VALU](valu) instruction on CDNA accelerators runs for a single quad-cycle (see [Layla Mah's GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah), slide 30).
Therefore, for simplicity, we simply report these metrics as "instructions per cycle".
```

(Issued_ipc)=
### Exploring "Issued" IPC via MFMA operations

```{warning}
The MFMA assembly operations used in this example are inherently unportable to older CDNA architectures.
```

Unlike the simple quad-cycle `v_mov_b32` operation discussed in our [previous example](VALU_ipc), some operations take many quad-cycles to execute.
For example, using the [AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/amd_matrix_instruction_calculator#example-of-querying-instruction-information) we can see that some [MFMA](mfma) operations take 64 cycles, e.g.:

```shell-session
$ ./matrix_calculator.py --arch CDNA2 --detail-instruction --instruction v_mfma_f32_32x32x8bf16_1k
Architecture: CDNA2
Instruction: V_MFMA_F32_32X32X8BF16_1K
<...>
    Execution statistics:
        FLOPs: 16384
        Execution cycles: 64
        FLOPs/CU/cycle: 1024
        Can co-execute with VALU: True
        VALU co-execution cycles possible: 60
```

What happens to our IPC when we utilize this `v_mfma_f32_32x32x8bf16_1k` instruction on a CDNA2 accelerator?
To find out, we turn to our `mfma` kernel in the IPC example:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/ipc/mi200/ --dispatch 8 -b 11.2 --decimal 4
<...>

```

In contrast to our [VALU IPC example](VALU_ipc), we now see that the IPC metric (11.2.0) and Issued IPC (11.2.1) metric differ substantially.
First, we see the VALU utilization (11.2.3) has decreased substantially, from nearly 100% to $\sim6.25\%$.
We note that this matches the ratio of:

```math
((Execution\ cycles) - (VALU\ coexecution\ cycles)) / (Execution\ cycles)
```
reported by the matrix calculator, while the MFMA utilization (11.2.7) has increased to nearly 100%.


Recall: our `v_mfma_f32_32x32x8bf16_1k` instruction takes 64 cycles to execute, or 16 quad-cycles, matching our observed MFMA Instruction Cycles (11.2.8).
That is, we have a single instruction executed every 16 quad-cycles, or:

```math
1/16 = 0.0625
```

which is almost identical to our IPC metric (11.2.0).
Why then is the Issued IPC metric (11.2.1) equal to 1.0 then?

Instead of simply counting the number of instructions issued and dividing by the number of cycles the [CUs](CU) on the accelerator were active (as is done for 11.2.0), this metric is formulated differently, and instead counts the number of (non-[internal](Internal_ipc)) instructions issued divided by the number of (quad-) cycles where the [scheduler](scheduler) was actively working on issuing instructions.
Thus the Issued IPC metric (11.2.1) gives more of a sense of "what percent of the total number of [scheduler](scheduler) cycles did a wave schedule an instruction?" while the IPC metric (11.2.0) indicates the ratio of the number of instructions executed over the total [active CU cycles](TotalActiveCUCycles).

```{warning}
There are further complications of the Issued IPC metric (11.2.1) that make its use more complicated.
We will be explore that in the [subsequent section](Internal_ipc).
For these reasons, Omniperf typically promotes use of the regular IPC metric (11.2.0), e.g., in the top-level Speed-of-Light chart.
```

(Internal_ipc)=
### "Internal" instructions and IPC

Next, we explore the concept of an "internal" instruction.
From [Layla Mah's GCN Crash Course](https://www.slideshare.net/DevCentralAMD/gs4106-the-amd-gcn-architecture-a-crash-course-by-layla-mah) (slide 29), we see a few candidates for internal instructions, and we choose a `s_nop` instruction, which according to the [CDNA2 ISA Guide](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/instinct-mi200-cdna2-instruction-set-architecture.pdf):

>Does nothing; it can be repeated in hardware up to eight times.

Here we choose to use a no-op of:

```asm
s_nop 0x0
```

to make our point.  Running this kernel through Omniperf yields:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/ipc/mi200/ --dispatch 9 -b 11.2

```

First, we see that the IPC metric (11.2.0) tops our theoretical maximum of 5 instructions per cycle (discussed in the [scheduler](scheduler) section).
How can this be?

Recall that Layla's slides say "no functional unit" for the internal instructions.
This removes the limitation on the IPC. If we are _only_ issuing internal instructions, we are not issuing to any execution units!
However, workloads such as these are almost _entirely_ artificial (i.e., repeatedly issuing internal instructions almost exclusively). In practice, a maximum of IPC of 5 is expected in almost all cases.

Secondly, we note that our "Issued" IPC (11.2.1) is still identical to one here.
Again, this has to do with the details of "internal" instructions.
Recall in our [previous example](Issued_ipc) we defined this metric as explicitly excluding internal instruction counts.
The logical question then is, 'what _is_ this metric counting in our `s_nop` kernel?'

The generated assembly looks something like:

```asm
;;#ASMSTART
s_nop 0x0
;;#ASMEND
;;#ASMSTART
s_nop 0x0
;;#ASMEND
;;<... omitting many more ...>
s_endpgm
.section        .rodata,#alloc
.p2align        6, 0x0
.amdhsa_kernel _Z4snopILi1000EEvv
```

Of particular interest here is the `s_endpgm` instruction, of which the [CDNA2 ISA guide](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/instinct-mi200-cdna2-instruction-set-architecture.pdf) states:

>End of program; terminate wavefront.

This is not on our list of internal instructions from Layla's tutorial, and is therefore counted as part of our Issued IPC (11.2.1).
Thus: the issued IPC being equal to one here indicates that we issued an `s_endpgm` instruction every cycle the [scheduler](scheduler) was active for non-internal instructions, which is expected as this was our _only_ non-internal instruction!


(SALU_ipc)=
### SALU Utilization

Next, we explore a simple [SALU](salu) kernel in our on-going IPC and utilization example.
For this case, we select a simple scalar move operation, e.g.:

```asm
s_mov_b32 s0, s1
```

which, in analogue to our [`v_mov`](VALU_ipc) example, copies the contents of the source scalar register (`s1`) to the destination scalar register (`s0`).
Running this kernel through Omniperf yields:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/ipc/mi200/ --dispatch 10 -b 11.2

Here we see that:
  - both our IPC (11.2.0) and Issued IPC (11.2.1) are $\sim1.0$ as expected, and, 
  - the SALU Utilization (11.2.2) was nearly 100% as it was active for almost the entire kernel.

(VALU_Active_Threads)=
### VALU Active Threads

For our final IPC/Utilization example, we consider a slight modification of our [`v_mov`](VALU_ipc) example:

```c++
template<int N=1000>
__global__ void vmov_with_divergence() {
    if (threadIdx.x % 64 == 0)
        vmov_op<N>();
}
```

That is, we wrap our [VALU](valu) operation inside a conditional where only one lane in our wavefront is active.
Running this kernel through Omniperf yields:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/ipc/mi200/ --dispatch 11 -b 11.2

```

Here we see that once again, our VALU Utilization (11.2.3) is nearly 100%.
However, we note that the VALU Active Threads metric (11.2.6) is $\sim 1$, which matches our conditional in the source code.
So VALU Active Threads reports the average number of lanes of our wavefront that are active over all [VALU](valu) instructions, or thread "convergence" (i.e., 1 - [divergence](Divergence)).

```{note}
We note here that:

1. The act of evaluating a vector conditional in this example typically triggers VALU operations, contributing to why the VALU Active Threads metric is not identically one.
2. This metric is a time (cycle) averaged value, and thus contains an implicit dependence on the duration of various VALU instructions.

Nonetheless, this metric serves as a useful measure of thread-convergence.
```

Finally, we note that our branch utilization (11.2.5) has increased slightly from our baseline, as we now have a branch (checking the value of `threadIdx.x`).

## LDS Examples

For this example, we consider the [LDS sample](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/lds.hip) distributed as a part of Omniperf.
This code contains two kernels to explore how both [LDS](lds) bandwidth and bank conflicts are calculated in Omniperf.

This example was compiled and run on an MI250 accelerator using ROCm v5.6.0, and Omniperf v2.0.0.
```shell-session
$ hipcc -O3 lds.hip -o lds
```

Finally, we generate our omniperf profile as:
```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n lds --no-roof -- ./lds
```

(lds_bandwidth)=
### LDS Bandwidth

To explore our 'theoretical LDS bandwidth' metric, we use a simple kernel:

```c++
constexpr unsigned max_threads = 256;
__global__ void load(int* out, int flag) {
  __shared__ int array[max_threads];
  int index = threadIdx.x;
  // fake a store to the LDS array to avoid unwanted behavior
  if (flag)
    array[max_threads - index] = index;
  __syncthreads();
  int x = array[index];
  if (x == int(-1234567))
    out[threadIdx.x] = x;
}
```

Here we:
  - Create an array of 256 integers in [LDS](lds)
  - Fake a write to the LDS using the `flag` variable (always set to zero on the host) to avoid dead-code elimination
  - Read a single integer per work-item from `threadIdx.x` of the LDS array
  - If the integer is equal to a magic number (always false), write the value out to global memory to again, avoid dead-code elimination

Finally, we launch this kernel repeatedly, varying the number of threads in our workgroup:

```c++
void bandwidth_demo(int N) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    load<<<1,i>>>(nullptr, 0);
  hipDeviceSynchronize();
}
```

Next, let's analyze the first of our bandwidth kernel dispatches:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/lds/mi200/ -b 12.2.1 --dispatch 0 -n per_kernel

╘═════════╧═══════════════════════╧════════╧════════╧════════╧══════════════════╛
```

Here we see that our Theoretical Bandwidth metric (12.2.1) is reporting 256 Bytes were loaded even though we launched a single work-item workgroup, and thus only loaded a single integer from LDS.  Why is this?

Recall our definition of this metric:

> Indicates the maximum amount of bytes that could have been loaded from/stored to/atomically updated in the LDS per [normalization-unit](normunit).

Here we see that this instruction _could_ have loaded up to 256 bytes of data (4 bytes for each work-item in the wavefront), and therefore this is the expected value for this metric in Omniperf, hence why this metric is named the "theoretical" bandwidth.

To further illustrate this point we plot the relationship of the theoretical bandwidth metric (12.2.1) as compared to the effective (or achieved) bandwidth of this kernel, varying the number of work-items launched from 1 to 256:

```{figure} images/ldsbandwidth.*
:scale: 50 %
:alt: Comparison of effective bandwidth versus the theoretical bandwidth metric in Omniperf for our simple example.
:align: center

Comparison of effective bandwidth versus the theoretical bandwidth metric in Omniperf for our simple example.
```

Here we see that the theoretical bandwidth metric follows a step-function. It increases only when another wavefront issues an LDS instruction for up to 256 bytes of data. Such increases are marked in the plot using dashed lines.
In contrast, the effective bandwidth increases linearly, by 4 bytes, with the number of work-items in the kernel, N.

(lds_bank_conflicts)=
### Bank Conflicts

Next we explore bank conflicts using a slight modification of our bandwidth kernel:

```c++
constexpr unsigned nbanks = 32;
__global__ void conflicts(int* out, int flag) {
  constexpr unsigned nelements = nbanks * max_threads;
  __shared__ int array[nelements];
  // each thread reads from the same bank
  int index = threadIdx.x * nbanks;
  // fake a store to the LDS array to avoid unwanted behavior
  if (flag)
    array[max_threads - index] = index;
  __syncthreads();
  int x = array[index];
  if (x == int(-1234567))
    out[threadIdx.x] = x;
}
```

Here we:
  - Allocate an [LDS](lds) array of size $32*256*4{B}=32{KiB}$
  - Fake a write to the LDS using the `flag` variable (always set to zero on the host) to avoid dead-code elimination
  - Read a single integer per work-item from index `threadIdx.x * nbanks` of the LDS array
  - If the integer is equal to a magic number (always false), write the value out to global memory to, again, avoid dead-code elimination.

On the host, we again repeatedly launch this kernel, varying the number of work-items:

```c++
void conflicts_demo(int N) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
    conflicts<<<1,i>>>(nullptr, 0);
  hipDeviceSynchronize();
}
```

Analyzing our first `conflicts` kernel (i.e., a single work-item), we see:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/lds/mi200/ -b 12.2.4 12.2.6 --dispatch 256 -n per_kernel

```

In our [previous example](lds_bank_conflicts), we showed how a load from a single work-item is considered to have a theoretical bandwidth of 256B.
Recall, the [LDS](lds) can load up to $128B$ per cycle (i.e, 32 banks x 4B / bank / cycle).
Hence, we see that loading an 4B integer spends two cycles accessing the LDS ($2\ {cycle} = (256B) / (128\ B/{cycle})$).

Looking at the next `conflicts` dispatch (i.e., two work-items) yields:

```shell-session
$ omniperf analyze -p workloads/lds/mi200/ -b 12.2.4 12.2.6 --dispatch 257 -n per_kernel

```

Here we see a bank conflict!  What happened?

Recall that the index for each thread was calculated as:

```c++
int index = threadIdx.x * nbanks;
```

Or, precisely 32 elements, and each element is 4B wide (for a standard integer).
That is, each thread strides back to the same bank in the LDS, such that each work-item we add to the dispatch results in another bank conflict!

Recalling our discussion of bank conflicts in our [LDS](lds) description:

>A bank conflict occurs when two (or more) work-items in a wavefront want to read, write, or atomically update different addresses that map to the same bank in the same cycle.
In this case, the conflict detection hardware will determined a new schedule such that the **access is split into multiple cycles with no conflicts in any single cycle.**

Here we see the conflict resolution hardware in action!  Because we have engineered our kernel to generate conflicts, we expect our bank conflict metric to scale linearly with the number of work-items:

```{figure} images/ldsconflicts.*
:scale: 50 %
:alt: Comparison of LDS conflict cycles versus access cycles for our simple example.
:align: center

Comparison of LDS conflict cycles versus access cycles for our simple example.
```

Here we show the comparison of the Index Accesses (12.2.4), to the Bank Conflicts (12.2.6) for the first 20 kernel invocations.
We see that each grows linearly, and there is a constant gap of 2 cycles between them (i.e., the first access is never considered a conflict).


Finally, we can use these two metrics to derive the Bank Conflict Rate (12.1.4).  Since within an Index Access we have 32 banks that may need to be updated, we use:

$$
Bank\ Conflict\ Rate = 100 * ((Bank\ Conflicts / 32) / (Index\ Accesses - Bank\ Conflicts))
$$

Plotting this, we see:

```{figure} images/ldsconflictrate.*
:scale: 50 %
:alt: LDS Bank Conflict rate for our simple example.
:align: center

LDS Bank Conflict rate for our simple example.
```

The bank conflict rate linearly increases with the number of work-items within a wavefront that are active, _approaching_ 100\%, but never quite reaching it.


(Occupancy_example)=
## Occupancy Limiters Example 


In this [example](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf/blob/dev/sample/occupancy.hip), we will investigate the use of the resource allocation panel in the [Workgroup Manager](SPI)'s metrics section to determine occupancy limiters.
This code contains several kernels to explore how both various kernel resources impact achieved occupancy, and how this is reported in Omniperf.

This example was compiled and run on a MI250 accelerator using ROCm v5.6.0, and Omniperf v2.0.0:
```shell-session
$ hipcc -O3 occupancy.hip -o occupancy --save-temps
```
We have again included the `--save-temps` flag to get the corresponding assembly.

Finally, we generate our Omniperf profile as:
```shell-session
$ omniperf profile -n occupancy --no-roof -- ./occupancy
```

(Occupancy_experiment_design)=
### Design note

For our occupancy test, we need to create a kernel that is resource heavy, in various ways.
For this purpose, we use the following (somewhat funny-looking) kernel:

```c++
constexpr int bound = 16;
__launch_bounds__(256)
__global__ void vgprbound(int N, double* ptr) {
    double intermediates[bound];
    for (int i = 0 ; i < bound; ++i) intermediates[i] = N * threadIdx.x;
    double x = ptr[threadIdx.x];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        x += sin(pow(__shfl(x, i % warpSize) * intermediates[(i - 1) % bound], intermediates[i % bound]));
        intermediates[i % bound] = x;
    }
    if (x == N) ptr[threadIdx.x] = x;
}
```

Here we try to use as many [VGPRs](valu) as possible, to this end:
  - We create a small array of double precision floats, that we size to try to fit into registers (i.e., `bound`, this may need to be tuned depending on the ROCm version).
  - We specify `__launch_bounds___(256)` to increase the number of VPGRs available to the kernel (by limiting the number of wavefronts that can be resident on a [CU](CU)).
  - Write a unique non-compile time constant to each element of the array.
  - Repeatedly permute and call relatively expensive math functions on our array elements.
  - Keep the compiler from optimizing out any operations by faking a write to the `ptr` based on a run-time conditional.

This yields a total of 122 VGPRs, but it is expected this number will depend on the exact ROCm/compiler version.

```asm
        .size   _Z9vgprboundiPd, .Lfunc_end1-_Z9vgprboundiPd
                                        ; -- End function
        .section        .AMDGPU.csdata
; Kernel info:
; codeLenInByte = 4732
; NumSgprs: 68
; NumVgprs: 122
; NumAgprs: 0
; <...>
; AccumOffset: 124
```

We will use various permutations of this kernel to limit occupancy, and more importantly for the purposes of this example, demonstrate how this is reported in Omniperf.

(VGPR_occupancy)=
### VGPR Limited

For our first test, we use the `vgprbound` kernel discussed in the [design note](Occupancy_experiment_design).
After profiling, we run the analyze step on this kernel:

```

Here we see that the kernel indeed does use _around_ (but not exactly) 122 VGPRs, with the difference due to granularity of VGPR allocations.
In addition, we see that we have allocated 4 "[AGPRs](agprs)".
We note that on current CDNA2 accelerators, the `AccumOffset` field of the assembly metadata:
```asm
; AccumOffset: 124
```
denotes the divide between `VGPRs` and `AGPRs`.


Next, we examine our wavefront occupancy (2.1.15), and see that we are reaching only $\sim50\%$ of peak occupancy.
As a result, we see that:
  - We are not scheduling workgroups $\sim25\%$ of [total scheduler-pipe cycles](TotalPipeCycles) (6.2.1); recall from the discussion of the [Workgroup manager](SPI), 25\% is the maximum.
  - The scheduler-pipe is stalled (6.2.2) from scheduling workgroups due to resource constraints for the same $\sim25\%$ of the time. 
  - And finally, $\sim91\%$ of those stalls are due to a lack of SIMDs with the appropriate number of VGPRs available (6.2.5).

That is, the reason we can't reach full occupancy is due to our VGPR usage, as expected!

### LDS Limited

To examine an LDS limited example, we must change our kernel slightly:

```c++
constexpr size_t fully_allocate_lds = 64ul * 1024ul / sizeof(double);
__launch_bounds__(256)
__global__ void ldsbound(int N, double* ptr) {
    __shared__ double intermediates[fully_allocate_lds];
    for (int i = threadIdx.x ; i < fully_allocate_lds; i += blockDim.x) intermediates[i] = N * threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    double x = ptr[threadIdx.x];
    for (int i = threadIdx.x; i < fully_allocate_lds; i += blockDim.x) {
        x += sin(pow(__shfl(x, i % warpSize) * intermediates[(i - 1) % fully_allocate_lds], intermediates[i % fully_allocate_lds]));
        __syncthreads();
        intermediates[i % fully_allocate_lds] = x;
    }
    if (x == N) ptr[threadIdx.x] = x;
}
```

where we now:
  - allocate an 64 KiB LDS array per workgroup, and
  - use our allocated LDS array instead of a register array

Analyzing this:

```

We see that our VGPR allocation has gone down to 96 registers, but now we see our 64KiB LDS allocation (7.1.8).
In addition, we see a similar non-schedule rate (6.2.1) and stall rate (6.2.2) as in our [VGPR example](VGPR_occupancy). However, our occupancy limiter has now shifted from VGPRs (6.2.5) to LDS (6.2.7).


We note that although we see the around the same scheduler/stall rates (with our LDS limiter), our wave occupancy (2.1.15) is significantly lower ($\sim12\%$)!
This is important to remember: the occupancy limiter metrics in the resource allocation section tell you what the limiter was, but _not_ how much the occupancy was limited.
These metrics should always be analyzed in concert with the wavefront occupancy metric!

### SGPR Limited

Finally, we modify our kernel once more to make it limited by [SGPRs](salu):

```c++
constexpr int sgprlim = 1;
__launch_bounds__(1024, 8)
__global__ void sgprbound(int N, double* ptr) {
    double intermediates[sgprlim];
    for (int i = 0 ; i < sgprlim; ++i) intermediates[i] = i;
    double x = ptr[0];
    #pragma unroll 1
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        x += sin(pow(intermediates[(i - 1) % sgprlim], intermediates[i % sgprlim]));
        intermediates[i % sgprlim] = x;
    }
    if (x == N) ptr[0] = x;
}
```

The major changes here are to:
  - make as much as possible provably uniform across the wave (notice the lack of `threadIdx.x` in the `intermediates` initialization and elsewhere),
  - addition of `__launch_bounds__(1024, 8)`, which reduces our maximum VGPRs to 64 (such that 8 waves can fit per SIMD), but causes some register spills (i.e., [Scratch](Mspace) usage), and
  - lower the `bound` (here we use `sgprlim`) of the array to reduce VGPR/Scratch usage

This results in the following assembly metadata for this kernel:
```asm
        .size   _Z9sgprboundiPd, .Lfunc_end3-_Z9sgprboundiPd
                                        ; -- End function

```

Here we see that our wavefront launch stats (7.1) have changed to reflect the metadata seen in the `--save-temps` output.
Of particular interest, we see:
  - The SGPR allocation (7.1.7) is 80 registers, slightly more than the 76 requested by the compiler due to allocation granularity, and
  - We have a ['scratch'](Mspace) i.e., private memory, allocation of 60 bytes per work-item

Analyzing the resource allocation block (6.2) we now see that for the first time, the 'Not-scheduled Rate (Workgroup Manager)' metric (6.2.0) has become non-zero.  This is because the workgroup manager is responsible for management of scratch, which we see also contributes to our occupancy limiters in the 'Scratch Stall Rate' (6.2.3).  We note that the sum of the workgroup manager not-scheduled rate and the scheduler-pipe non-scheduled rate is still $\sim25\%$, as in our previous examples

Next, we see that the scheduler-pipe stall rate (6.2.2), i.e., how often we could not schedule a workgroup to a CU was only about $\sim8\%$.
This hints that perhaps, our kernel is not _particularly_ occupancy limited by resources, and indeed checking the wave occupancy metric (2.1.15) shows that this kernel is reaching nearly 99% occupancy!

Finally, we inspect the occupancy limiter metrics and see a roughly even split between [waveslots](valu) (6.2.4), [VGPRs](valu) (6.2.5), and [SGPRs](salu) (6.2.6) along with the scratch stalls (6.2.3) previously mentioned.

This is yet another reminder to view occupancy holistically.
While these metrics tell you why a workgroup cannot be scheduled, they do _not_ tell you what your occupancy was (consult wavefront occupancy) _nor_ whether increasing occupancy will be beneficial to performance.
