This subdirectory houses the input markup for Omniperf documentation using
Sphinx. Changes committed here on the main branch will automatically be built
and pushed live using a Github action.

You can build a local copy of the documentation in this directory using
"make html" assuming you have the necessary sphinx dependencies installed.
