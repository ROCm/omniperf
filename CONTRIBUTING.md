## How to fork from us

To keep our development fast and conflict free, we recommend you to [fork](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-compute/fork) our repository and start your work from our `dev` branch in your private repository.

Afterwards, git clone your repository to your local machine. But that is not it! To keep track of the original develop repository, add it as another remote.

```
git remote add mainline https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-compute.git
git checkout dev
```

As always in git, start a new branch with

```
git checkout -b topic-<yourFeatureName>
```

and apply your changes there.
