# Omniperf

## General

Omniperf is a system performance profiling tool for machine
learning/HPC workloads running on AMD MI GPUs. The tool presently
targets usage on MI100, MI200, and MI300 accelerators.

* For more information on available features, installation steps, and
workload profiling and analysis, please refer to the online
[documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/omniperf/en/latest/).

* Omniperf is an AMD open source research project and is not supported
as part of the ROCm software stack. We welcome contributions and
feedback from the community. Please see the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for additional details on our
contribution process.

## Development

Omniperf follows a
[main-dev](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
branching model. As a result, our latest stable release is shipped
from the `amd-mainline` branch, while new features are developed in our
`amd-staging` branch.

Users may checkout `amd-staging` to preview upcoming features.
