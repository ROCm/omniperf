This section details the various execution pipelines of the
:doc:`compute unit <compute-unit>`.

.. _desc-valu:

.. _desc-vmem:

Vector arithmetic logic unit (VALU)
-----------------------------------

The vector arithmetic logic unit (VALU) executes vector instructions
over an entire wavefront, each :ref:`work-item <desc-work-item>` (or,
vector-lane) potentially operating on distinct data. The VALU of a CDNA™
accelerator or GCN™ GPU typically consists of:

*  Four 16-wide SIMD processors (see :hip-training-pdf:`24` for more details).

*  Four 64 or 128 KiB VGPR files (yielding a total of 256-512 KiB total
   per CU), see :ref:`AGPRs <desc-agprs>` for more detail.

*  An instruction buffer (per-SIMD) that contains execution slots for up
   to 8 wavefronts (for 32 total wavefront slots on each CU).

*  A vector memory (VMEM) unit which transfers data between VGPRs and
   memory; each work-item supplies its own memory address and supplies
   or receives unique data.

*  CDNA accelerators, such as the MI100 and :ref:`MI2XX <mixxx-note>`, contain
   additional
   :amd-lab-note:`Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA) <amd-lab-notes-matrix-cores-readme>`
   units.

To support branching and conditionals, each wavefront in the VALU
has a distinct execution mask which determines which work-items in the
wavefront are active for the currently executing instruction. When
executing a VALU instruction, inactive work-items (according to the
current execution mask of the wavefront) do not execute the instruction
and are treated as no-ops.

.. note::

   On GCN GPUs and the CDNA MI100 accelerator, there are slots for up to 10
   wavefronts in the instruction buffer, but generally occupancy is limited by
   other factors to 32 waves per :doc:`compute unit <compute-unit>`.
   On the CDNA2 :ref:`MI2XX <mixxx-note>` series accelerators, there are only 8
   waveslots per-SIMD.

.. _desc-salu:

.. _desc-smem:

Scalar arithmetic logic unit (SALU)
-----------------------------------

The scalar arithmetic logic unit (SALU) executes instructions that are
shared between all work-items in a wavefront. This includes control flow
such as if/else conditionals, branches and looping pointer arithmetic, loading
common values, and more.

The SALU consists of:

*  A scalar processor capable of various arithmetic, conditional, and
   comparison (etc.) operations. See
   :mi200-isa-pdf:`Chapter 5. Scalar ALU Operations <35>`
   of the CDNA2 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Reference Guide for more
   detail.

*  A 12.5 KiB Scalar General Purpose Register (SGPR) file

*  A scalar memory (SMEM) unit which transfers data between SGPRs and
   memory

Data loaded by the SMEM can be cached in the :ref:`scalar L1 data cache <desc-sl1d>`,
and is typically only used for read-only, uniform accesses such as kernel
arguments, or HIP’s ``__constant__`` memory.

.. _desc-lds:

Local data share (LDS)
----------------------

The local data share (LDS, a.k.a., "shared memory") is fast on-CU scratchpad
that can be explicitly managed by software to effectively share data and to
coordinate between wavefronts in a workgroup.

.. figure:: ../data/performance-model/lds.*
   :align: center
   :alt: Performance model of the local data share (LDS) on AMD Instinct
         accelerators
   :width: 800

   Performance model of the local data share (LDS) on AMD Instinct MI-series
   accelerators.

Above is ROCm Compute Profiler's performance model of the LDS on CDNA accelerators (adapted
from  :mantor-gcn-pdf:`20`). The SIMDs in the :ref:`VALU <desc-valu>` are
connected to the LDS in pairs (see above). Only one SIMD per pair may issue an
LDS instruction at a time, but both pairs may issue concurrently.

On CDNA accelerators, the LDS contains 32 banks and each bank is 4B wide.
The LDS is designed such that each bank can be read from, written to, or
atomically updated every cycle, for a total throughput of 128B/clock
(:gcn-crash-course:`40`).

On each of the two ports to the SIMDs, 64B can be sent in each direction per
cycle. So, a single wavefront, coming from one of the 2 SIMDs in a pair, can
only get back 64B/cycle (16 lanes per cycle). The input port is shared between
data and address and this can affect achieved bandwidth for different data
sizes. For example, a 64-wide store where each lane is sending a 4B value takes
8 cycles (50% peak bandwidth) while a 64-wide store where each lane is sending
a 16B value takes 20 cycles (80% peak bandwidth).

In addition, the LDS contains conflict-resolution hardware to detect and handle
bank conflicts. A bank conflict occurs when two (or more)
:ref:`work-items <desc-work-item>` in a :ref:`wavefront <desc-wavefront>` want
to read, write, or atomically update different addresses that map to the same
bank in the same cycle. In this case, the conflict detection hardware will
determine a new schedule such that the access is split into multiple cycles with
no conflicts in any single cycle.

When multiple work-items want to read from the same address within a bank, the
result can be efficiently broadcasted (:gcn-crash-course:`41`). Multiple
work-items writing to the same address within a bank typically results undefined
behavior in HIP and other high-level languages, as the LDS will write the value from the
last work-item as determined by the hardware scheduler (:gcn-crash-course:`41`).
This behavior may be useful in the very specific case of storing a uniform
value.

Relatedly, an address conflict is defined as occurring when two (or more)
work-items in a wavefront want to atomically update the same address on the same
cycle. As in a bank-conflict, this may cause additional cycles of work for the
LDS operation to complete.

.. _desc-branch:

Branch
------

The branch unit is responsible for executing jumps and branches to execute
control flow operations.
Note that Branch operations are not used for execution mask updates, but only
for “whole wavefront” control-flow changes.

.. _desc-scheduler:

Scheduler
---------

The scheduler is responsible for arbitration and issue of instructions for all
the wavefronts currently executing on the :doc:`CU <compute-unit>`. On every
clock cycle, the scheduler:

* Considers waves from one of the SIMD units for execution, selected in a
  round-robin fashion between the SIMDs in the compute unit

* Issues up to one instruction per wavefront on the selected SIMD

* Issues up to one instruction per each of the instruction categories among the waves on the selected SIMD:

  * :ref:`VALU <desc-valu>`

  * :ref:`VMEM <desc-vmem>` operations

  * :ref:`SALU <desc-salu>` / SMEM operations

  * :ref:`LDS <desc-lds>`

  * :ref:`Branch <desc-branch>` operations

This gives a maximum of five issued Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), per-SIMD,
per-CU (:hip-training-pdf:`Introduction to AMD GPU Programming with HIP <>`,
:gcn-crash-course:`The AMD GCN Architecture - A Crash Course <>`). On CDNA
accelerators with :ref:`MFMA <desc-mfma>` instructions, these are issued via the
:ref:`VALU <desc-valu>`. Some of them will execute on a separate functional unit
and typically allow other :ref:`VALU <desc-valu>` operations to execute in their
shadow (see the :ref:`MFMA <desc-mfma>` section for more detail).

.. note::

   The IPC model used by ROCm Compute Profiler omits the following two complications for
   clarity. First, CDNA accelerators contain other execution units on the CU
   that are unused for compute applications. Second, so-called "internal"
   instructions (see :gcn-crash-course:`29`) are not issued to a functional
   unit, and can technically cause the maximum IPC to *exceed* 5 instructions
   per-cycle in special (largely unrealistic) cases. The latter issue is
   discussed in more detail in the
   :ref:`'internal' IPC <ipc-internal-instructions>` example.

.. _desc-mfma:

Matrix fused multiply-add (MFMA)
--------------------------------

CDNA accelerators, such as the MI100 and :ref:`MI2XX <mixxx-note>`, contain
specialized hardware to accelerate matrix-matrix multiplications, also
known as Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA) operations. The exact
operation types and supported formats may vary by accelerator. Refer to the
:amd-lab-note:`AMD matrix cores <amd-lab-notes-matrix-cores-readme>`
blog post on GPUOpen for a general discussion of these hardware units.
In addition, to explore the available MFMA instructions in-depth on
various AMD accelerators (including the CDNA line), we recommend the
`AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator <https://github.com/ROCm/amd_matrix_instruction_calculator>`_:

            GPRs required for C: 4
            GPRs required for D: 4
            GPR alignment requirement: 8 bytes

For the purposes of ROCm Compute Profiler, the MFMA unit is typically treated as a separate
pipeline from the :ref:`VALU <desc-valu>`, as other VALU instructions (along
with other execution pipelines such as the :ref:`SALU <desc-salu>`) typically can be
issued during a portion of the total duration of an MFMA operation.

.. note::

   The exact details of VALU and MFMA operation co-execution vary by
   instruction, and can be explored in more detail via the following fields in
   the
   `AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator's detailed instruction information <https://github.com/ROCm/amd_matrix_instruction_calculator#example-of-querying-instruction-information>`_:

Non-pipeline resources
----------------------

In this section, we describe a few resources that are not standalone
pipelines but are important for understanding performance optimization
on CDNA accelerators.

.. _desc-barrier:

Barrier
^^^^^^^

Barriers are resources on the compute-unit of a CDNA accelerator that
are used to implement synchronization primitives (for example, HIP’s
``__syncthreads``). Barriers are allocated to any workgroup that
consists of more than a single wavefront.

.. _desc-agprs:

Accumulation vector general-purpose registers (AGPRs)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accumulation vector general-purpose registers, or AGPRs, are special
resources that are accessible to a subset of instructions focused on
:ref:`MFMA <desc-mfma>` operations. These registers allow the MFMA
unit to access more than the normal maximum of 256 architected
:ref:`vector general-purpose registers (VGPRs) <desc-valu>` by having up to 256
in the architected space and up to 256 in the accumulation space.
Traditional VALU instructions can only use VGPRs in the architected
space, and data can be moved to/from VGPRs↔AGPRs using specialized
instructions (``v_accvgpr_*``). These data movement instructions may be
used by the compiler to implement lower-cost register-spill/fills on
architectures with AGPRs.

AGPRs are not available on all AMD Instinct™ accelerators. GCN GPUs,
such as the AMD Instinct MI50 had a 256 KiB VGPR file. The AMD
Instinct MI100 (CDNA) has a 2x256 KiB register file, where one half
is available as general-purpose VGPRs, and the other half is for matrix
math accumulation VGPRs (AGPRs). The AMD Instinct :ref:`MI2XX <mixxx-note>`
(CDNA2) has a 512 KiB VGPR file per CU, where each wave can dynamically request
up to 256 KiB of VGPRs and an additional 256 KiB of AGPRs. For more information,
refer to `this comment <https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/1689#issuecomment-1553751913>`_.
