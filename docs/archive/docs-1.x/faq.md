**1. How do I export profiling data I've already generated using Omniperf?**

In order to interact with the Grafana GUI you must sync data with the MongoDB backend. This interaction is done through ***database*** mode.

Simply pass the directory of your desired workload like so,
```shell
$ omniperf database --import -w <path-to-results> -H <hostname> -u <username> -t <team-name> 
```
**2. python ast error: 'Constant' object has no attribute 'kind'**

This comes from a bug in the default astunparse 1.6.3 with python 3.8. Seems good with python 3.7 and 3.9.

Workaround:
```shell
$ pip3 uninstall astunparse
$ pip3 astunparse
```

**3. tabulate doesn't print properly**
Workaround:
```shell

```
