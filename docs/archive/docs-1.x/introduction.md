## Scope

MI Performance Profiler ([Omniperf](https://github.com/ROCm/omniperf)) is a system performance profiling tool for Machine Learning/HPC workloads running on AMD Instinct (tm) Accelerators. It is currently built on top of the [rocProfiler](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler/en/latest/rocprof.html) to monitor hardware performance counters. The Omniperf tool primarily targets accelerators in the MI100 and MI200 families. Development is in progress to support MI300 and Radeon (tm) RDNA (tm) GPUs.

## Features

The Omniperf tool performs system profiling based on all available hardware counters for the target accelerator. It provides high level performance analysis features including System Speed-of-Light, IP block Speed-of-Light, Memory Chart Analysis, Roofline Analysis, Baseline Comparisons, and more...
  
Both command line analysis and GUI analysis are supported.
