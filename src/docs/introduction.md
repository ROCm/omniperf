## Scope

MI Performance Profiler ([Omniperf](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omniperf)) is a system performance profiling tool for Machine Learning/HPC workloads running on AMD MI GPUs. It is currently built on top of the [ROC Profiler](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/rocprofiler) to monitor hardware performance counters. The Omniperf tool primarily targets MI100 and MI200 silicon. Development is in progress to support MI300 and NAVI GPUs. 

## Features

The Omniperf tool performs system profiling based on all approved hardware counters for MI200. It provides high level performance analysis features including System Speed-of-Light, IP block Speed-of-Light, Memory Chart Analysis, Roofline Analysis, Baseline Comparisons, and more... 
  
Both command line analysis and GUI analysis are supported.
